Both experiences have been terrible.  The staff is very rude and does not go out of their way to smile or go the extra mile.  The decor is bright and nice, but it is not maintained very well.  The lobby could use a good cleaning.  Also, there is a $15/day charge for parking at this hotel.  The location is great, you can walk to pretty much anywhere, but it is very noisy even on higher floors.  We were mostly disappointed because we got a double room for Valentine's day and when we asked to for a king room, J.J. told us that we had booked online so we got whatever they had.  We felt like we were treated as second rate citizens because we had booked online.  Then when we got to the room, the faucet was so loose it fell over.  It was fixed promptly, but made a bad first impression.  Neither time my husband and I have stayed at this hotel have we had a good experience.  I would strongly recommend staying at one of Charlotte's other nice hotels if you want a good experience.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Fi5sQxROyTLp5qDuYKz6bQ"}

I also wish that I could provide them with ZERO STARS.  This company is the worst to deal with.  It started off with my order being processed twice due to an issue with their website.  So I chatted with an analyst to have it resolved.  She then had to call me because she said my credit card was being rejected.  After about 45 minutes she realized she was entering it incorrectly.  Then the day they should have been coming out to install I found out that they changed my street address in their computer when moving from the ordering system to the installation ordering system.  Therefore they installer never made it to my apartment.  When I noticed the change on the emails I received I called immediately (about 15 minutes after my scheduled install window).  The woman on the phone told me that she corrected it and contacted the driver who confirmed the new address and would still be coming.  After waiting another 2 hours with no contact I called back and the new person told me that it isn't possible to just update an address and that she had to put in a whole new order.  Oh and my specific apartment unit was not in there system so they would have to send someone out to survey before the installation so I couldn't set up another installation for almost 2 weeks.  (Mind you they had every other apartment in my building and when I originally placed the order they had no problem finding my address and signing me up)  The analyst also submitted an escalation about my issue so I could speak with a supervisor (after waiting for one for about a half an hour on the phone) within 24 hours.  Waited the whole day and no call back.  So I chatted online again and was told the escalation process takes 2-3 days not 24 hours.  I then said I just wanted to cancel any pending orders that I had in the system, to which I was told I had to call in to do.  Ok so I try to call after being hung up on by their system twice, hung up on once by a person, transferred and being on hold and trying to get through for almost a hour I finally get through to someone (nearly in tears to just end the process at this point) she asks if there is anything she can do to keep my business, I go through everything I have been through and she says \"I have gone ahead and cancelled your order\" nothing else.  So of course I am not surprised when I look at my credit card bill and they have charged me.  So here I go again...try chatting online and they tell me they can send a check, I say I want my credit card charged back, and they tell me I have to call a local office.  But I placed the order online, then I am on hold again.  Their response \"I can submit an escalation and you will hear back from someone in 2-3 days\".  I'm done I throw in the towel trying to deal with them.  I submitted a dispute through my credit card company and hope they can get through to them.  I am now using Clearwire.  Took me 2 minutes to place the order online, it was overnighted to me, 2 minutes to plug in and log on.  Why didn't I go with them first??  I WILL NEVER USE TIMEWARNER CABLE.  I would go without internet before I use them.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vKtMsWeAaThimXGo9Ic_Og"}

For shorthand math, that's 25 minutes on the phone. At this point in time, I'm just praying I don't get disconnected.

Just to clarify -- My service is cancelled, correct?\"\nLess-than-able TWC Employee: \"Yes.\"\nMe: \"You have my forwarding address for my last bill, correct?\"\nLess-than-able TWC Employee: \"Yes. Is there anything else I can help you with today?\"\n\n......\"help?\" I was almost insulted that she used that as a descriptor. \"Help\" isn't something that TWC provides. They provide song and dance and circumvention as opposed to service. \n\nThe story doesn't end there. I had to go to this location on Morehead to return the modem we rented. BAD IDEA. It's the saddest place on earth. They opened the doors at 8am and the one woman behind the counter had a small line of \"eager\" customers. She barely paid any mind to anyone and then said, with little to no interest, \"Can I help who's next?\" Then, randomly, she just left and started bringing boxes in to the room one by one.....WHY? Nobody knows. \n\nI got to the counter, returned the modem as swiftly as possible to the rather sad employees, and hastily left the non-existent customer service clubhouse TWC runs there. It was unreal. The whole experience, from start to finish, was the most agonizing exchange I've ever had to go through. Completely malarkey.  \n\nMoral of the story: If you want to do \"business\" with TWC, beware.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vKtMsWeAaThimXGo9Ic_Og"}

I called in 2 full weeks ahead of my requested disconnection date, just to make sure everything would go smoothly. After holding for an hour, I finally talked to a lady who scheduled the disconnect, gave me a confirmation number, and everything. We went to return the equipment at the local TWC office; waited in line over an hour to turn in the equipment. \n\n2 weeks later, I check the internet - they still don't show my service disconnected. I get on line with a chat agent at TWC, and he says I'll have to call and they have no record of me disconnecting. I got very upset at the thought of calling and holding for another hour to talk to someone so I really let him have it. He then agreed to disconnect me as of 9/6, like it was some sort of favor to me. Never mind the fact that I even had the cancellation number from the phone call. \n\nSo today I look online again, and they show that I owe them $25. Actually, they owe ME $25 for the week of service I paid for and hadn't used. So, I get online again, and guess what? the chat agent that I talked to 2 weeks ago didn't set my disconnect for the original date. Instead he did it 2 weeks after! \n\nSo I got online with another chat agent today who once again apologized and is \"escalating my case\". I've now spent over 6 hours trying to help the incompetent CSR's at TWC to actually do this correctly. Meanwhile, we've had AT&T now for over a month. Guess what? Not a SINGLE outage, not a single disruption. And customer service is prompt and helpful. \n\nI will never, ever sign up for TWC again. I don't care if I have to go without TV someday vs. paying TWC another cent. They should be a Harvard case study on how to run your business in such an incompetent, offensive way that you actually lose customers for life. I guess if they don't do it right this time, I will just pay the $25 (so they don't do something to mess up my credit) and then file a complaint with the State utilities commission. \n\nAvoid TWC. Not worth the money you will pay, and certainly not worth the pain you will experience if you ever need to contact them for anything.

I booked a reservation for 12 almost two weeks in advance of the date we wanted to dine.  I explained it was a going away party for a member of our team and that we wanted a large table.  I was told that would be no problem.  I was then told I had to give a credit card number to hold the table.  I questioned this as I have made numerous reservations and have never had to do this previously.  Chris stated he would not be able to hold without the information so I reluctantly gave it to him.  We arrived as a group a few minutes early for our reservation at 11:30am.  We were immediately greeted and seated as one of only two occupied tables in the entire restaurant.  The problem is that five (5) of us were at one round table and five (5) of us were at another.  We requested a different table or to push the two together.  We were told by our waiter that it was not possible to do this as the tables were not made to fit together and they had a full booking.  We had one waiter and the other table had a different waiter.  Our waiter was awful.  We had to request drink refills two separate times during our 45 minute wait on our food and he never came back to check on us once he served our food. When I eat out at a supposed \"fine dining\" establishment and pay $16 and change for a 6 ounce filet, I expect it to be superb. It wasn't.  I would have sent the dish back, but the waiter never returned.  Since it was a business group we couldn't wait another 45 minutes.  A lady at my table ordered the white bean dish and it was so salty she couldn't finish it.  Another diner at my table got the macaroni and cheese as an entree.  The noodles were under done and a bit chewy.  We requested our separate checks the next time we saw the waiter as we needed to get back to work.  When he brought the checks, they had charged us a 20% gratuity.  I asked why and was told because we were in a large party.  I explained to him that I did not feel we should have to pay the gratuity as my reservation was not honored and our service was lacking.  He said it was policy.  I asked for the manager who introduced himself as Eric.  I explained the situation to him.  Having to ask for refills, the long wait, the waiter not coming back ,etc.  He stated we are a large party and it is policy.  I told him we were treated as separate parties.  We were not seated together, did not share the same waiter and did not get served at the same time.  He refused to budge but said he would ask the owner.  I was then approached by the owner/chef.  It was apparent from the look on his face when he approached me that he was ready for battle. His opening words were, \"You got great service and great food so you should pay for it.\"  I told him the service was not great, the food was not great.  I tried to explain the situation.  He told me I should just pay my bill.  I told him we were treated as two separate parties and not seated at the same table.  He stated, \"Well, you walked in the door together.\"  I told him if the $ was that important to him, I would pay it, but that I work for a large corporation within 2 blocks of his restaurant and that I would have thought repeat business and keeping a good relationship with his diners would be worth more than that to him.  He said he didn't appreciate me threatening him (???!!??!) and for me to pay my bill and get out.  I gave the waiter my credit card assuming he meant to pay it without the gratuity, which I was more than willing to do.  When the bill came back, they had charged me the gratuity so I refused to sign it.  Another lady in my party of 5 paid her bill with a 10% tip.  The waiter brought the check back and said it was short.  She said she meant to only tip 10%.  He told her that they had had people ARRESTED FOR REFUSING TO PAY THEIR TIPS BEFORE.  She became frightened and put another $5 bill in the folder and left the restaurant.  Did I mention this lady is in her 60's?  When I refused to sign my check the manager, Eric, told me that by refusing to sign I was refusing to pay and that they would call the police.  I told him to go ahead, but wanted to see the written policy.  He told me it was on the website.   ??? Everyone checks a website before making a reservation?  Then told me it was my lucky day & they wouldn't be calling the cops, but would be taking it up with the credit card company.  Good luck.

MEDIOCRE brow shaping with rows of sticking out hairs along the curve. She did that way too rapidly with tweezers (so I guess she can't really do the fine work of threading a brow). The edge of a properly shaped brow should be perfectly sharp but also natural as if it grew that way. Holes should appear to be filled in magically. My brows also now sit a bit unevenly on my face. She wears a magnifier and this may give her a peephole view that is inadequate to perceive the overall shape, but it should have allowed her to create a totally smooth edge and NO STRAYS.\nNo pre-sanitation or post-care of the skin.\nA mark where she caught my skin in her thread.\nPlus, cold rude staff.", "type": "review", "business_id": "I9S-4czHzMVfKejCiAuXag"}

In search of some where to have dinner in the uptown area, to celebrate my friends Birthday, we came across this quant  place. bypassing 5star gourmet restaurants we opted to have  a quite dinner with some soul food. The restaurant was interestingly decorated  and the menu was appetizing.  The service on the other hand was not.  I had never tried shrimp and grits before  so I being a special occasion I decided to try something new. when the dish came to the table the presentation was nice however the taste was not satisfactory. it was overloaded with onion and It was not enjoyable to me. So I then asked the waitress if something could be done because I didn't like  the dish. She told me \"I have to get the manager, because I can't change once the food is on the table.\"  I told her that was fine. The manager never came to offer any apologies nor explain what the solution could be. the waitress comes back after like 15mn and says \"She says pick something of the menu and we'll trade it out.\" I then chose the chicken dinner. The waitress nor the food did not come back for almost another 20mn. she then comes to the table not to refill drinks or to apologize for the wait. but to offer to bag up the meal and bring the check. at this point I was embarrassed for bringing my friend to this place and irritated because I was hungry and very annoyed with the service I told her yes please bring the check. she brings a check not only with the meal I changed for but also the initial meal that I did not eat. I was confused asked to speak tho the manager by another waitress. that waitress says sure she's the lady over there in the red shirt.  and walks the other way.  So I then call the manager over to clarify that this was a mistake. she says \"If the owner was here he would not be playing with y'all. He would make you pay for both. I on the other hand will take it off.\" I was floored at the way she spoke to me and the fact that the owner would make a patron pay for something they didn't like. I felt stereo typed and embarrassed that it was my people to treat us this way. So needless to say we will not be returning back to this establishment ever!

I started with the soul rolls, but thought the mixture of flavors and textures did not harmonize well.  It seemed to be a fried app just for the sake of being fried.  But without the pleasing crunch I expected.\nBut the real let down was my shrimp and grits.  What they served me was a bowl of lumpy grits (one particular lump was too big for my spoon to handle) swimming in a truly awful brown mess.  The color made me think the sauce might be rich, but it was the opposite.  I could probably recreate the flavor with water, thickener and food color - that is just how tasteless it was.

I made a reservation with Mimosa for my family's Thanksgiving meal in 2012.  I called a month in advance and inquired about the menu.  I was explained all the menu choices that would be available and with Mimosa Grill's reputation, decided to go forward with it.  When we arrived on Thanksgiving Day, the restaurant did not have a menu - it was a buffet.  Never was this mentioned during our 15 minute phone call when I made the reservation.  A lot of people do not like buffets - so this should be made clear!  Secondly, the chef had sizzling salmon on the buffet.  This caused the restaurant to REEK of salmon and therefore every bite of food I took tasted like salmon (which I don't particularly like).  The rest of the food was overly heavy and greasy.  But, hey, at least I didn't gain weight over the holiday.  \n\nI believe when a restaurant serves a holiday meal, there is a special trust they must have with their customers.  We choose to trust the restaurant with our most treasured memories. Also, holidays are so booked, we can't leave and go to another restaurant!  Mimosa Grill blew it (although I am pretty sure we will look back at this and laugh).  We did call Zink's (where we ate last year and owned by the same company) to see if they could fit us in.  Unfortunately, Zink's had also chosen to go with a buffet this year (unlike last year)  and didn't have any tables available.  What a shame - I will definitely be more discriminating next holiday, and my sister is even entertaining the idea of cooking.", "type": "review", "business_id": "NTfUFk8GyOLL1uPbEO-pVg"}

I recently decided to revisit this club and had a bad experience .  I saw a dancer that caught my eye. I offered her a drink and a dance. After her canoodling me  I gave in and said i'll take  one ( 30 dollar)  dance.\n\nAfter some pleasant conversation over the drink( I treated her to),  the dance began .  After four minutes the song was over and I reached in my pocket to give her the 30 + 5 dollars for a tip, when she explained I actually owed her 60 dollars  because it was 2 songs.  By my count it was one dance. Apparently she decided to count the 5 minutes of  time we spent talking over the drinks i bought her as part of the dance as well.   I thought she was kidding and gave her the $ 35. This  beautiful little angel suddenly became a crazy little devil. She called her manager and made me out to be some kind of lunatic lowlife cheapskate.   I politely explained the situation to the  manager but he insisted i pay up which i promptly did .  After wards i made a quick exit.   \n\nThere was no mistaken that I was being blatantly scammed here.  I was in the club for less then 10 minutes and hadn't even finished my first beer, and was not drunk in the least.   Unless you don't mind being scammed by a dancer, and paying 60 dollars for a 4 minute dance I would  steer clear from this establishment .  A night I was hoping to relax over a beer and a beautiful dancer cost me 80 dollars for less then 10 minutes of harassment and aggravation.  It appears to be a pretty good club and i couldn't say if they regularly scam the patrons,  but  they sure as hell scammed me.  On principle I'll avoid this place  and I'll tell my friends to go elsewhere as well. The are  a ton of clubs in the area with gorgeous girls  that even have signs on the table that you will never pay for a dancer's time or for  her simply talking to you.\n\nYou've  been warned .\n\nJay", "type": "review", "business_id": "qxaoJ2cd7-cvEPTmSgBAyA"}

First, let me say they put the slice of pizza straight in a brown bag, not horizontal.  So, needless to say when I got back to the office the toppings had literally slid off, the slice was soggy and the bag was covered in grease, ugh! As for the salad, the onions were brown, and I mean bad brown, plus the lettuce was brown and wilted as well.  So, I slid all the toppings off the pizza, ate the dough and ate the garlic knots, after having tried to pick through the lettuce and onions for something fresh, NO.\nI should have known this would have been a bad experience when the guy at the counter was rude and things moved very slowly with only three people in the restaurant.

I went to Phil's a total of 3 times. \n\nThe first time I went I got 2 beers, drank them, attempted to pay but was told they can't run my card without at least $10 ran, so after ordering a shot to bring my bill up to par, I paid and left.

And for that I am sorry. But she did not even attempt to speak to me before publicly jumping to conclusions she \"heard\" insinuating I was taking lewd pictures for my own personal pleasure. \n\nThe bartenders are nothing except a lifeless ordinary, working to earn cash and doing a bad job at trying. There are other establishments near here that offer more for less, with decent conversation and pleasant aromas. \n\nFor as slow as this place always seemed to be, I can't imagine why the staff are quick to judge. But perhaps that's the normal clientele that frequents this establishment, and I can see why. I obviously will never be back. \n\nIf you do not want to be looked at and judged when you walk in and then talked about disparagingly when you leave, stay as far away from here as possible.

I dine there during Queen's Feast Restaurant Week yesterday. i was very excited because i only heard good things about the place . To Start the evening off there weren't any seat left inside the restaurant so we were escorted to a dining room outside the lobby. There were so many terrible things that occur that evening where do i begin. First the ceasar salad was the worst salad i have ever had it taste like a 2 day old bag salad you get at your local grocery store. it wasn't fresh, i was missing courton in mine. Next it time for the entree.  2 of my  guest ask for a med-rare skin their  steak came   super well done . so dry i didn't know if i was filet mignon or A cheap dry roast beef.  She returned her and it came back out much better . I had the chicken breast that  once i got to the bone it blood and under cook.  and to finish the even off they were out of the cheesecake, and some of the guest  got the flourless coco cake which had molded rasphberry on her plate. yikes . it almost went in her mouth. I would have expect better quality of food for a 4 star restaurant.  She got her meal for free due to all the mistakes. but i didn't get antything for my bloody chicken. I will never go here again. :-(", "type": "review", "business_id": "CChwRoYVXA3QZulS8a6xOQ"}

We chose to go out to eat here as we had only heard great things about Capital Grille. We will never return to this establishment for a meal again. \n\nOur waiter was very nice and the decor of the restaurant is beautiful as well. For starters I got the mozzarella basil tomato salad. It was pretty good so no complaints there. I chose the special of the night for my entree which was three small steaks prepared in three signature ways. I loved two of them the balsamic one was pretty bad but not inedible. Our water glasses were left empty several times which I thought was weird considering how much a meal like this costs. My husband ordered the porterhouse and he asked for it to be medium. Well it was bordering on the side of well-done and I tasted his and didn't like it at all. He thought it was very dry and it wasn't hot it seemed as though it had been sitting around before they brought it out to us. Honestly the steaks he grills from Teeter have more flavor than this dish. This was obviously very disappointing but we just thought ok not worth the money but we would possibly return for the specialty dishes at a future date. \n\nThe main reason I am giving a one star review is because I woke up in the middle of the night with awful stomach pains and have been sick for the past 10 hours. My husband was nauseas but not as sick as me.  We didn't sleep practically at all last night and because of this i would never ever return here. I would recommend grilling steaks on your own grill and not wasting a ton of money to get an underwhelming sickening experience.", "type": "review", "business_id": "CChwRoYVXA3QZulS8a6xOQ"}

The waitress hung on our chairs while taking orders, she kept making references to getting off of her shift and drinking at the bar and waited 15 to get drinks. After we had ordered we heard a loud crash from the kitchen, the waitress said \"yeah that was your food so it will take a while for some of you\". Half of the table recieved their meal, while the rest of the table had to watch everyone eat. My girlfriend asked for a rare steak and it came out well-done! When she asked for a new steak the waitress, instead of appologizing she said \"well, I guess we will be waiting on 4 plates instead of 3\". At the end of the meal the waitress said \"well I guess you will all want seperate checks\" - as if she was annoyed. The entire meal was awful and took 3 hours! The waitress also added on 20% gratuity - which really irritated me. I will never go back to Savannah Red.", "type": "review", "business_id": "C9CF7p53Y0L5ErKRhhFhng"}

It was a friend's 30th birthday so we wanted to go somewhere and light up a cigar to celebrate. Given Cutters is one of the few (if not only) indoor cigar smoking bars/options, your hands are kind of tied if you like cigars. I called (at 11pm) before going and was told last call was at 12:30 and the bar closes at 1am. At midnight, the waitress comes around for last call. When I ask what happened to 12:30 for last call, she says that the food and beverage director wants to shut down early - no other reason for the early closing. \n\n20 minutes later, a waitress comes over while we are finishing our cigar and drinks and says, \"Alright guys, you have to leave now\" and opens the door. If this is customer service, I'd hate to see what customer disservice looks like. I guess paying $15 worth of cutting fees for the cigars we brought with us and purchasing several drinks was not enough to buy good customer service. \n\nWe were clearly unhappy about the way we were being treated but left anyway. On the way out, the waitress holding the door makes unnecessary comments about our slowness in leaving the bar at 12:20 (which should be open until 1am). The waitress and the food and beverage director proceed to follow us out of the hotel, ask if we were staying there and threatened to have us kicked off the property. The sad part is we had not spoken with the food and beverage director up until this point so instead of inquiring about our displeasure and what happened, he immediately jumps to conclusions. Needless to say, Marriott Charlotte City Center and Marriott's Corporate Customer Service center will be receiving letters regarding this incident and the customer service of its staff. \n\nI personally hope Cutters gets what it deserves and closes up. It gives Charlotte entertainment options a bad name and the customer service was the worst I've experienced in a long time. \nCutters does not have to worry about my patronage going forward and Marriott should be ashamed to have such poor customer service associated with its brand.", "type": "review", "business_id": "7BVCmaxhvXgEpx7J-SQ4QA"}

However, the Uptown UNO in Charlotte is a disgrace to the UNO name. Twice now, we've attempted to eat there, only to be met with poor customer service skills at the hostess stand. The first time was an early evening, and there were about 10 people (different parties) in line, empty tables...and nobody being seated. After five minutes of not seeing any hostess, we left. The second time, we visited in the afternoon for lunch. We were pleased to see that there were people actually dining in there, several empty tables, and only one couple waiting to be seated. We watched as the first couple were seated. Needless to say, the one hostess on duty never returned. Having watched her every step of the way in seating the last couple, it seemed like she was just wandering through the restaurant aimlessly, not doing much of anything. And she never acknowledged us previously either. We waited for about five minutes, watching her, not doing much of anything. That's when I took action and walked over to her to remind her that we were waiting to be seated. She unenthusiastically walked back to the hostess stand with me. She looked around at the several empty tables and said, \"It'll be about 10 minutes.\" Enough was enough. We left.

Three screens show movies and videos which is fine.  But it gets really annoying with the DJ calling out the names of every band and song. Perhaps he thinks you were too drunk to remember or too young to have lived it.  We all know these songs by heart, it's totally cliche and they're not teaching us anything new.  The DJ just likes being the center of attention which provides an abhorrent atmosphere.  \n\nThey also completely mash songs together, sometimes running over the best parts of the end or even the middle of a song with the beginning of another.  They do not watch the dance floor which is DJ Lesson #1.  If a good thing is already happening on the dance floor, don't mess it up.  I heard three crashes in a row on the dance floor one night and the entire crowd just stops moving.  It makes it a memorable night.

It is THE worst room I have ever stayed in ever. \nThere is NOTHING modern about the hotel, there is a difference in vintage style and just plain and out of date. The last time I saw a bathroom this small and out of date was spring break in Panama city and that was a cheap last minute hotel we had to take but at least it was right on the beach. I don't care how close this is to epicenter, it's NOT worth the price.\nWe had friends from out of town that just couldn't believe how gross the room was. We only stayed one night.

What a disaster!  www.aquavina.com states the following:  \"Complimentary Valet service is available Monday through Saturday after 5pm, on College Street, between Stonewall & 2nd Street\".  Upon going to this location, there was no valet parking, so we parked in the parking garage below the restaurant for a $5 charge.  Upon entering the restaurant we asked our waiter about the valet parking and he stated  \"there was no valet parking, but I will stamp a sheet of paper so you can be be reimbursed by the parking attendant when you leave.\"  Then the waiter brought our water, and poured from a pitcher.  Another couple said down a few minutes after us and they were asked by a different waiter if they wanted sparking water, bottled water or tap water. We were never given that option.  After this, it was quite a while before our waiter even came back to take our order. The other couple who arrived after us ordered and received their food before we did.  Once we ordered, my husband ordered filet mignon which came with asparagus.  He asked to substitute the asparagus (which was only two pieces) for macaroni and cheese and the waiter said that would be fine.  The meal came by someone other than our waiter and came with the asparagus.  He advised the food server he asked for mac and cheese, so this person said he would get the mac and cheese.  Several minutes later the server brought the mac and cheese and our waiter still had not been back to our table.  In addition, we had asked for an extra napkins and that was never delivered, so my husband asked the server to bring one which he did.  From the beginning to the end of our visit, we saw our waiter maybe three times., once to bring the water, once to take our order, once to bring the bill.  He did visit our table only once during our meal to see if all was o.k.  It was necessary to ask another waiter to bring a glass of wine.  Then we received the check and there was an additional $7 charge for the mac and cheese.  This was a substitution for the asparagus, not a side dish.  No one ever mentioned an additional $7.  We talked with the manager about this and in addition we discussed the non-existent service we had received.  The manager brought us a corrected check with an $11 discount.  The price for this meal was over $100 without the discount and without a tip.  So we were more than ready to leave asap,. We return to our vehicle with our validated stamp for the parking refund.  No attendant was to be found to refund our $5 parking charge.  I did call and speak with the manager regarding this and we were told I could come back to the restaurant and he would refund the $5.  Now really, would I want to re-visit this restaurant under any circumstances?  NOT IN A LIFETIME!!!  This is supposedly one of Charlotte's finest.....well our experience was not one of Charlotte's finest.  For this type of so-called upscale restaurant, what we experienced was less than the service one would receive at McDonald's.

Let me explain. \n\nFor starters, I just want to say that this store is clean, well-presented and has some very nice girls working in it. The scents of candles and lotions are incredible, and they were hard to resist with their Fall displays front and center with names like \"Autumn Leaves\" and \"Cinnamon Pumpkin\". Their prices are reasonable and their gift items are very nice. (Sigh)...so here's why I'll never shop here again. \n\nI came in to check out the store and in my browsing around, grabbed a tester for a particular scent and gave it a try. I always like to do this with lotions and perfumes; before I commit to purchasing, I put it on and walk around with it for a few hours to let it soak in since it always smells different than when you first put it on. So I left the store and for the next hour could not stop smelling my hands - it was so good it was intoxicating. I don't even remember which scent it was, but that's not important anyway. An hour and a half later I was back in the store and heading for the counter, bottle in hand. \n\nSo I'm reading the back. I'm trying to be ever so conscious about my purchases, especially beauty products, in that I only buy products that are paraben-free and NOT tested on animals. Call me uptight, but I just don't think animals should be tortured so I can smell like fake juniper. I scan the label and see that it does contain parabens, but it smells so friggin good I make an exception. Then I see it: \"This finished product not tested on animals.\" And for a minute I think, Great! Ready to buy. And then...this...\"finished\" product?  What the heck does that mean? Normally if a product is not tested on animals it will just say \"Not tested on animals\", or \"We NEVER test our products on animals\", or the like. And if it says nothing, you always assume that they do test on animals. But \"This FINISHED product\"? So, the final product that fills the bottle in my hand, the one that I intend to use, has not been tested on any animal. But what about everything before that? And then I just got mad. Very mad. Do they think we are idiots? Some big shot at BBW must believe that their customers are totally mindless, lazy, and can be easily fooled by the wording they chose. I don't know what made me more mad; the fact that they do test on animals, or the fact that they take us all for idiots and try to play like they don't run the tests. Either way, out of principle, I put the bottle back and decided I will never again give a dime of my money to BBW.

Brookdale Drive - Rocky River....Always trying to get you to do another eye exam.  Took in my son's new prescription in June to make sunglasses. They wanted to do another eye exam today. They said it had been 2 years since last eye exam.  I explained to them -  I brought in the new prescription in June and you used it on his sunglasses.  The lady kept arguing. My son walked out. I called and finally had to hang up. Also, one other time I told them only an eye exam  not the doctor exam (due to diabetes) they went ahead and did the doctor exam after I was very clear with them not to do a doctor's exam. Had to have them take it off.  My husband's eye exam that was done here was wrong too. Had to pay to have another eye exam. Going elsewhere... Brookdale is the worst for customer service.\n\nLet me add:  Received a call from the manager, December this morning and she said my son did not tell them that he had sunglasses made in June.  I told her, yes he did and so did I on the phone.  I told December that they need to look in the computer and her reply was:  \"thank you for that tip\".   Another unprofessional smart mouth.  All this could have been avoided if they knew how to use their computers.  Need some training in customer service too.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zQOvb29OxZ-NCBnKSyHfYg"}

They didn't have any openings in their schedule, so they referred us to Carolina Appliance Service. We called on Monday, 12/17/12 and were told the technician would call us the morning of Friday, 12/21 between 7:00 and 7:30 am to inform us when he would arrive. My wife then confirmed her day off from work.\n\nBy 9:00, she had not received a phone call, so she called the company. The person answering the phone said he would find out what was going on and call back in 20 minutes. 40 minutes later, having not received a phone call, my wife called back, to be told that the technician had called in sick. She asked who would be taking his place for the service call, and was informed that no one would, since he is the only one who serves this area (Steele Creek, southwest Mecklenburg County) and that we would have to reschedule.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- Carolina Appliance Service set up a day to service our washing machine and failed to provide service on the day agreed upon.\n- Carolina Appliance Service did not call us to inform us that the technician was out sick, and apparently didn't even know their technician wasn't working until we called.\n- Carolina Appliance Service did not make an attempt to replace the technician with another, and placed the responsibility of handling the situation caused by this technician's illness onto us.\n\nIn addition, the representative on the phone (my wife spoke with the same man with each phone call) treated her as if it was a great inconvenience to him that he had to deal with her. When my wife asked if he had planned to call her to tell her that they would not be servicing our washing machine, he said, \"Well, he's sick,\" as if the technician's illness absolves them of all responsibility of contacting their customers.\n\nEach interaction with this company suggests that they are an amateur organization who only deals with their customers when it is convenient to them to do so. I would love to comment on their actual service prowess, but given the difficulty we had in getting them to simply answer our questions on the phone, I doubt the day will ever come when we give them the chance to prove themselves in that category.", "type": "review", "business_id": "pbuSIs6lEKkDpFCQbpOcbA"}

How do the posts not come with the earrings (especially when you throw down a lot of Benjamins to begin with)? That is just crazy. \n\nNext, the necklace he gave me as a gift was a tad too long. So I went in and had the receipt and asked to exchange the chain for a shorter one. The employee then proceeded to tell me that I would have to drop it off, they would have it the following day, and there would be a charge to shorten it. What?! \n\nPaying for a gift given to you is nuts. That's most of a jeweler's business...sweethearts buying for their sweetheart as a surprise and they won't always get the size right.\n\nIn any case, thankfully the two employees that my husband worked with when he was in and the other that helped me when I was there worked with us to comp the earring posts and got my chain corrected that same moment at no charge. The employees and jewelry itself saved this review from being a 1 star.\n\nNeedless to say, after these recent experiences I'm even more inclined to take my business to the local mom & pops jewelers. I don't appreciate the extra fees and hassle that seems to be part of the process with this company. Jared's has gotten too big and too corporate and lost its focus on building relationships and loyalty with customers. I don't remember Jared's being like this in the past, but I heard they purchased Zales and a lot has changed. \n\nToo bad, Jared's. Your jewelry is gorgeous and employees are kind, but the shopping experience you create for the buyer has lost its charm and is now tainted in my book.", "type": "review", "business_id": "UlY2l61fqYgOa1dvogNCRw"}

I think I must have been at a different buffet than these other reviewers, because this was horrible.  When we walked in, it was like we were in the South Pacific.  Seriously.  The thermostat must have been set at 90.  A nice change from the 40 degree weather outside, but after about three minutes, it was the worst.  Maybe that's for atmosphere, but it was not enjoyable.\n\nTo make the experience even less appetizing, the place is cramped and the staff does not help at all in this regard - they are constantly in the middle of the aisles, writing tickets and getting drinks in the middle of the walking areas and the like.  Again, they could be going for atmosphere, and having the staff constantly around is nice, but with overbearing heat and little room to move it's not good.  It's bad.  Really bad.  If you don't like personal space, you're good.  Really good even.  Otherwise, it stinks.  Literally.  I've been to restaurants in big cities, where rent is outrageous, that have more room to move than this.  In Pineville, there ought to be all sorts of elbow room (Schoolhouse Rock anyone?).\n\nYes, there is a sushi bar where a guy makes it in front of you.  Let me first tell you that I'm not really a sushi guy.  I like California rolls and those little rice cakes with shrimp on them, and a few other things, but none of the more exotic stuff.  But this was nasty.  He would take a big fried thing and plop it down on a plate and squirt some heavy mayo-like sauce all over it.\n\nThat's not too bad, right?  Well, once the rolls were gone, he'd do it again - without cleaning the plate.  That's right, there was a buildup of this mayo on the platter.  Several varieties, all right there under the lights.  It was pretty sickening.  Like a sushi hog pond.\n\nOn the regular buffet, it wasn't too bad, but it wasn't that good either.  If you want a Southern food buffet (meat, rolls, corn), it's okay.  But the Chinese food was just average.  Add that to the place, the staff, the price - go elsewhere.  China King and Dragon House aren't far away, and Tin Tin is just up the street (though I'm not a huge fan of Tin Tin either).  You'll have a much nicer experience.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5p3Tqyp19UowO0-dAFvxMw"}

Not really. They're all the same. This was my second time here. Second time after my other engine oil changer shop annoyed me for the last time, but that's another review. First time here was OK-good. This time? Wasn't impressed. Irritated actually. Why do all these automobile engine oil changeries want to sell me on the power steering fluid flush? Or the fuel system cleaner? Or the fuel system additive (\"improves fuel economy by 20%\" whoaaaa)? Or a new air filter. The only thing they didn't want to do was flush my brake fluid. Guess it was OK? They drained the engine oil then brought me in and proceeded to walk me through 200 services they could perform. Everything for $460. All of this after I said the engine oil change was all that was necessary. The guy really didn't care and continued to read off the \"sales\" screen. At one point I just about got into an argument with him when he started talking about change intervals. I \"learned\" that the recommended change interval was 3000 miles (\"we don't go by months any more\" noted!) if you drive in X conditions (stop & go traffic, cold starts, drag racing, etc.). Otherwise it was 7500 miles. Perfect. He then asked if I wanted to go with 3000 miles, 7500 miles or my own decision. Huh? I'm going to get my vehicle's oil changed whenever the hell I want, aren't I? I didn't understand why he was asking that or the reason. He couldn't explain why he was asking the question either. We went round and round for a few seconds then I just said 5000 miles and he entered it in the computer. After that he walked through the remaining 100 services they offered and then showed me my air filter. Apparently, with the amount of dust that is in there, my air filter is reducing my gas mileage by 1-2%. Who knew? All I know is a dirty filter is more affective at trapping particles than a clean filter. I passed on the filter change and all the services, paid the $46 and was on my way. He was kind enough to introduce me to his manager and walk me to my car. That was a little awkward though. And, I saw them do it to everyone before me, so I wasn't special. After I got in my vehicle I noticed the next change interval was 3000 miles from now...why did I tell him 5000 miles again?\n\nWhere am I going with this? I know what I want and I need. If I claim I know and I don't, then it is on me. If I tell you I only want an engine oil change then that is all I want. Simple as that.\n\nNot sure if I'll go back here.

The entry process is pretty simple. Walk to the building, pay your money ($10 for admission and skate rental) and grab your rental skates at the next window. \n\nThe negatives... I was disappointed by the ice quality and the rental skates. The surface of the ice was pretty rough and needed a serious resurfacing. The rental skates were extremely dull. Yes, I know that they are rentals but it would have been nice if the blades had a decent edge. I also wish that they would have set up some cones inside the rink. This would have provided better separation for general skaters (the people that just want to skate circles) from the more experienced/technical skaters (the people that want to spin and jump). I've been to rinks that used the cones and it provided a better experience for all skaters. It would have been helpful if all skaters were aware of skating etiquette... There were also a few times that I found myself having to dodge people going the wrong direction!! \n\nThe positives... They serve beer and wine!!

My finacee asked for a Sunset Wheat beer, which was on tap. We weren't paying attention to her as she poured, but once he sipped the beer he immediately knew it was a Sam Adams. OK, mistake. But when we looked over at the taps, the two were no where near each other. We flagged here down when she returned to the bar (she kept disappearing) and she apologized, went to pour the correct beer and only got a half a glass out of it. Just a minute, she promised. \n\nLiterally, like 15 minutes later, she finally came back but then ran off again before we could tell her we were ready to put in our food order. We were starving! We finally flagged here down and placed the order. Good thing we ordered when we did, because the food took forever to come out!! By the time we got it we were SO hungry. I ordered the Mahi Mahi over rice, and I wouldn't have finished it if I wasn't starving - the Mahi was really dry, and they added so much spice to the dish that whatever flavor was there was killed. Granted, it is a sports bar, but I've worked in Sports bars before that served amazing fish dishes. If it's not going to be good, it shouldn't be on the menu.

The only reason I give it a measly 2 stars is because there are better options all around, this sort of competition should have been motivation to update the menu and decor. \n\nMy best experience here:  We used it for a Sunday brunch my family put on during our wedding weekend.  For that experience the food was great, the service was excellent, but that is not their \"normal\" operation.  \n\nI guess if it's raining out and you are stuck and have no place to go I'd check it out. But under any other circumstances you'd probably get a better meal by walking a half block in any direction.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vIXUw1cLG84-m8LzOg3f-w"}

In what world this beer is toasty, malty, finishing a tad hoppy...or award winning is beyond me. This beer is Budweiser with some caramel food coloring. This beer had no personality whatsoever!

The bottom of the bun was completely soggy and the sandwich as a whole was bland. Our guest of honor (the birthday girl) ordered a steak which she had to return because it was almost raw inside. She had asked for medium well. Several members of our group DID, however, like their food.\n\nGoing back to the service, several members of our party waited several minutes for drink refills. Also, we had to flag our waiter down for our checks after waiting close to (if not more than) 20 minutes. Even after we gave him our checks and credit cards, he took close to another 10 minutes to bring them back. \n\nOur best guess is that he knew he was adding an 18% gratuity to our checks because of our party size, so he took his time doing everything.

However, it became evident that either we were placed in a section different from the areas she was working as we kept seeing her less and less or I can just ignore my guest because I think I'm cute and smile and everything will be okay. At the end of our meal, which was very good, she offered us dessert, we opted for another beer which never came. We would catch a glance here and there of her for the next 20 minutes and finally she came over and asked if I beer made it to us. Did you bring me my drink? Then no, I have not gotten my beer. She would look for it right away, but I asked her to just close us out as it just wasn't nice to be there any longer, no excuse, no apology, just said okay, smiling away and walked away to what I hoped would be a quick return with my bill. She again left for another 10 minutes. When she returned I asked her what exactly happened that our drinks never made it to us? Was someone else supposed to bring it, did she forget? She said that someone else usually brings it, she was helping out the bar by bringing our drinks, someone must have taken it, oh my god, i'll just smile at these guys and everything will be fine.... no.... i just want good service. The server who was on our side was taking care of all his clients, bringing them drinks so im pretty sure I was getting the run around. I asked her who the manager was and she said Michael and again walked away. Pretty disrespectful attitude to have in a customer service environment. Next time I come to Charlotte I need to stick to the many many other places with great food and folks that want to take care of their clients. My opinion is that the food here was darn good and consistent, the beer is excellent, the service which is the most important, was \"rock bottom\".", "type": "review", "business_id": "ym9QwkmB5ZKTyj7q5huTDw"}

First, my rating of 2/5 stars is based primarily on the food, not the service.  \n\nI dined with a friend on a week night.  The restaurant was pretty empty, no wait for a table.  Our server was friendly and adequate, not magnificent.\n\nI decided to give Presto a try since they had a groupon coupon a while back.  So I had some money to spend, and Iwas able to taste quite a few dishes.  We started off with two appetizers: calamari and crab dip.  Calamari was very good; however, the sauce was, well, gross.  It was overly sweet and had an odd flavor.  We just ignored this and ate the calamari, as is.  The crab dip was another disappointment.  We were given plenty of chips, way more than we had dip for, which is never a great sign.  The cheese had a Velveeta consistency which I absolutely despise!  The cheese was loaded on the top with almost no crab flavor.  Toward the bottom there were whole chunks of crab...and you guessed it...now without any cheese!  \n\nI ordered the lasagna which came with a salad.  I ordered the Caesar salad.  Wow, this was just embarrassing (for them).  It was literally chopped Romaine with bottled dressing (I'd bet all my money - Ken's Steakhouse non-creamy kind).  I had about 4 bites and just put it aside.\n\nThe lasagna.  Well, remember that sauce with the calamari?  That's what is in the lasagna!  I actually had to send the dish back.  I was so disturbed by this sauce that I HAD to ask what was in it.  Well, tell me what you think - tomato sauce with cinnamon, and brown sugar.  \n\nI traded it in for a sandwich.  I just didn't know what to do.  I got a veggie sandwich with fries.  As a PS - bread was over saturated with oil but veggies tasted good.  Fries were under seasoned.  \n\nNot going back, but I think this place may be better as a lunch destination.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9fxTX1uyyYF4ugx68AG2sg"}

The look is very modern which I happen to love. It has a decent gym, which is also rare for a hotel. There is a very soothing bar area with live, gentle jazz music.  The staff are very professional in demeanor and friendly.  This COULD be an awesome place to stay. \n\nI experienced the following over two stays:\n\nI arrive 11pm, exhausted from travel, only to be told that the hotel is full.  The only room they have left to offer me is half a \"parlor\" room. I was given a SOFA BED to sleep on. I had made the reservation several weeks prior, with guaranteed late arrival. \n\nI get to the room and the electronic key does not work. I call the front desk on my cell phone and wait in the hall 20 minutes half asleep for a guard to show up. His key does not work either.  \n\nOk, this kind of thing happens sometimes at the best hotels, right?  \n\nI gave a shirt and slacks to laundry. That evening I receive someone else's underwear instead of my own clothes. \n\nI gave a pair of jeans to dry clean, specifying not to wash because they would shrink. Well the jeans arrived that evening no longer my size.\n\nA pattern develops.\n\nOn the third night, around 11pm a large heavy set man knocks at my door. He claims to be security but show no identification.  He wants to see my id.  Highly suspicious, I don't open the door and I slip my gym copy of my license under the door. Later he returns with police and insists I accompany them to the front desk. Later they apologize for the error.  What were they were thinking?\n\nA waitress in the bar area ignores several requests for menu and a drink over a 20 minute period. The bar area has maybe half a dozen customers at the time. \n\nA gym attendant wants you to sign in but has no pen. \n\nThe \"weather report\" button on the phone gives you a recording describing YESTERDAY's weather.\n\nEtcetera.\n\nBottom Line:  Stay here for the serenity and beauty of the decor, but you will need the patience of a saint!", "type": "review", "business_id": "4nFqPL-glgDm9v7bZptskQ"}

FOOD. The restaurant (Ember, Bar 10) is a pretty terrible and relatively expensive choice. Examples: Omelet = $18, and it is greasy, tasteless, and they used canned mushrooms; Breakfast buffet (the reason I got the omelet) is typically left to become stale and lukewarm; Dinner choices are typically salty (i.e. Fattoush salad) and greasy (i.e. sandwiches and burgers). I will say that the pancakes were excellent, but they are not the best (nor do they beat Hyatt's pancakes). \n\n2. LOCATION. While the Omni and other comparable hotels surround restaurants, shopping, and other area attractions, this hotels is 5 blocks from anywhere (even a pharmacy). Need I say more?\n\n3. SERVICE. No doorman, concierge has no good suggestion but \"Try Ember,\" and housekeeping seems to come only when you are in your room. On housekeeping, I am also quite sure they do not even vacuum as some cracker crumbs I spilled were still there TWO days later. They also tend to forget some essential (i.e. washcloth or soap). \n\nIf this were a cheap, sub-$100 per night hotel, I would manage. For Charlotte, which is not terribly in demand, this hotel should be spotless, sexy, or at least charming. It is neither, and for that reason, I suggest one try other hotels before this one.", "type": "review", "business_id": "4nFqPL-glgDm9v7bZptskQ"}

NINE DOLLARS for a bowl of oatmeal in the morning, or $20 if you wanted the breakfast buffet.

Prior to that visit, we had eaten at Ratcliffe on 3-5 occasions, and the food had always been some of the better in Charlotte, save for a few items here and there- their chicken dishes are never very good, the mini biscuits they serve are like cold little rocks, and there is an excessive use of truffle oil going on with the grits and a few entrees (to the point that we would ask that grits not be included with our meal, the smell makes my fiance ill). But outside of that, everything had been pretty good, with generally decent service.\n\nBut then we had the October incident- after that, we never went back again. My fiance had called the day before to make a reservation and had told the host it was my birthday- we don't expect any special treatment because of this, but we'd hoped we would get a slightly better seat than what they usually gave us, which was a tiny two person table against the wall (they did it every time we went). So we arrive on our special night, and are (after the host actually showed up) escorted to the tiniest, crappiest table in the whole place, in the far back left corner next to the water station. The person that seated us was curt and unfriendly. Ok- maybe the other tables were reserved? But mind you, whenever we went, the restaurant was always under half-full, usually well under half-full- the rest of the night, I think I counted maybe 5 couples/groups in and out of the place. \n\nI can't recall if the server was male or female, I simply remember that they were not friendly, because it surprised me for the place. The dishes that night were sub-par, which was a first. Some people complain about the portion size- I don't see the problem, the food is well presented, and whenever we order the tasting course, we come out full! Anyway, the whole night, someone was always right behind my head clanking around a water pitcher, and it wasn't pleasant. Our server was slow to wait on us, and while we're used to the fact that it can take up to three hours to get out of the place (we've actually listened to tables around us complain about the slow preparation/service, to the point of anger, but we realize it takes time to artfully prepare food, so we don't have an issue with it) it was taking an exceedingly long time to be waited on. \n\nAlso, we've watched the chef come out and pleasantly make his rounds almost every time we were there, and he'd speak to almost everyone, never to us, even if he walked right by our table. \n\nIt was a miserable birthday dinner-  bad seat, bad service, and less than stellar food made quite the impression on the boy and I, and we never went back again. It just isn't worth the cost- if we're going to spend over $100 on a meal, we expect it to be much better than that, especially on a special occasion.\n\nWe are always polite and cheerful, well dressed (no jeans and such!), and we're well-educated in local/organic/gourmet food. I have zero clue as to why we would be treated poorly and stuffed into small tables- we're young, 24/25, maybe that's it. I was wearing a vintage fur coat my Dad had given me for my birthday that day, maybe the fur thing irked them. Maybe it's because we rarely order wine, as we don't care to drink. I honestly have no clue!  But it left a bad taste, and we have since found better restaurants to give our regular business to.", "type": "review", "business_id": "df7cda6f5lMADGnoVHd8pg"}

The Manager heard that was I was unhappy with the new girls attempt and sent me a gift card to their salon. A very nice follow up and great recovery. So I would say, sure - check them out.

In addition to that little gem, the guy in the next room decided to conduct business with Bombay at 3am. We listened to mellifluous Hindi for damn near two hours.  I don't blame him, everybody's gotta earn a living, instead I fault the hotel.

Upon arrival, we were promptly greeted by plenty of construction for the new Knight's ballpark, making getting there a challenge. Once we found our way to the entrance, the clerk at the desk decided that the phone call - possibly a personal call, possibly a take-out order - was much more important than our business. Regardless, we eventually made our way to the room, and it was nice in appearance. Not over-the-top or anything, but nice for a Residence Inn, and nice for our night out.\n\nUnfortunately, the thermostat is the \"hotter and colder\" variety - not much different than the kind that used to be mounted under the window, it's just now on the wall. Is it really that much more to have the kind you set an actual temperature? It means that throughout the night, it gets way too hot, or way too cold, and makes for an uncomfortable night.\n\nThere are two televisions - one in the living area and one in the bedroom. The one in the living area works with the lineup card, while the one in the bedroom has the digital assignments, such as 76-0010 and whatnot, meaning you can't find anything (including HBO), so if you want to actually watch a show, you'll probably end up watching on the hard-as-a-rock sleeper sofa in the living area.\n\nIf you have to flush the toilet (and many people prefer this option), you lose all water in the bathroom. Not most, or even a particular temperature. It's gone. Not forever, so don't be completely alarmed. But for a few seconds, water completely stops. Not sure if this is unique to this room, or to the 11th floor, but it is a bit odd.\n\nThe hot breakfast is, well hot, but the offering wasn't the greatest. In fact, some other quick-serve, business-style hotels offer a better service and they are only deemed \"continental\".

I don't won't to sound pretentious, but this place feels dirty and you will most likely step in vomit or at least spilled beer. As others have said, it's mostly hip-hop, when I was there I rarely heard any house or trance. The crowd definitely trends younger, mostly in their teens or low 20s. I'm 25 and I almost felt too old there. But maybe that says more about me than it does Bar Charlotte. For that reason, I can't give this place less than two stars.

Rice and bean, shrimp creole, one kids plate of 2 chicken fingers, and one kids vegetable plate.  Also, kids meals did not include a drink, and they charge $2.00 for a child's drink.

Don't know what that meant; did they run out of spinach?  Strange. We ended up with two other omelettes, the garden and the shrimp creole.  We had to ask three different waitresses for our accompanying toast and biscuit, and once we had our food, our waitress interrupted our prayer to ask if we needed ketchup (understandable, but most servers notice bowed heads, even if it's kinda awkward).  We did need the ketchup, but it didn't come until the end of our meal, and my wife's home fries were already cold.  My regular cup of coffee was mediocre, my shrimp creole omelette had 2 small shrimp inside (super disappointing, as they were tasty), making my $8 omelette mostly egg and tomato sauce, and my wife's toast was hard as a rock.\n\nObviously a rough experience for us this morning, but Mert's gets the second star because my wife loved her omelette (the garden), my biscuit and grits were pretty good, and they let us choose our seating (with a young child, this can be pretty important).

I was in town earlier this month with my Mom and toddler while we visited my youngest brother who was working in nearby Kannapolis.  We were able to sit down right away and outdoors which was great.  However, we were highly disappointed by the food.  And, the experience is still memorable enough for me to write about now.\n\nFirst, they were out of the fried green tomatoes which we wanted to try and we were actually there relatively early to when they opened.  The eggroll-style appetizer that was recommended instead was good but definitely within the same criteria of what we were looking for.  99% of the menu has fried food which my brother was most disappointed about since we chose the restaurant without too much input on his part.  My Mom and I decided to share the Mert's Famous Salmon Cakes.  While the size was decent, the taste was lacking and I felt it might be slightly under-cooked.  For our sides, we chose greens and the red beans both of which were just ok.  And, I will actually say the greens were my favorite food out of what I had if forced to choose.  My brother ordered the Shrimp Creole which just tasted like tomatoes and the shrimp was not popcorn style as described on the menu.  If it had tasted better I think my brother could have been happy that he found something not fried on the menu even though he had decided if he was going to make a diet exception that he was looking forward to it being popcorn shrimp.  After our waitress checked on us she said as a person from New Orleans had we asked her she would have told us that the Shrimp Creole is not on her recommendation list.  However, because other customers have enjoyed it she does not deter people form ordering it...tough position to be in I guess.  My brother also ordered the potato salad which was very heavy on the mustard and vinegar.  I'm accustomed to this style of potato salad but like I said it just had too much mustard for my liking.  My daughter had the chicken tenders from the kids menu which I found to be on the salty side but she seemed to enjoy them.  She also liked the okra and tomato and yams sides that we ordered for her.  The server was nice and she took decent care of us.  She forgot more coffee like my Mom requested but we also noticed that she seemed to have several tables.  \n\nOverall I would say I'm not likely to give it another chance just because it seemed like we were in an area with a lot of choices which might have been a lot better.  I don't know if the chef was having off day or what but I just left very disappointed and felt bad that I was the primary person pushing to try Mert's during our brief trip to Charlotte.", "type": "review", "business_id": "mpDxBBGywUE6GRRKja3sBA"}

We went for Sunday brunch and were seated in the bar with the bartender as our server even though the place had many seats open. We started by ordering drinks off of their specialty cocktail menu. They had advertised a Jalapeno Margherita. After about 10 minutes and well after my dining companion had received their drink, the bartender came over and said that I needed to choose another drink because she could not find the vodka. We ordered shrimp and grits which were served with a film layer on top of the gravy as if it had been sitting an excessive amount of time in the kitchen and a minuscule portion of grits. The dish had fine flavor but was nothing special. My dish was the Mimosa Eggs Benedict special but unfortunately the eggs in the benedict were cooked hard so no delicious yolk to ooze onto the dish as intended. The bartender forgot we were there for awhile and our drinks were empty and then appeared to be caught up in eating some pizza and talking to other employees and we had to walk over just to pay and get out of there. I might give this place another try during a busy night but was very disappointed. This may be one of those places that is living off of a good start and good reviews but has suffered a major decline in both quality and service. Oh and by the way, if you are going to advertise a drink and don't have the ingredients then please offer the person a cocktail of their choice complimentary as an apology.

The bad news is that they were the best part of the meal. The m&c had good texture and balance but was highly seasoned and both my dining partner and I felt that it was too salty.

A supervisor ran around the restaurant screaming at customers about last call acting as if his paying customers were nuisances. His staff behind the counter talked about him and the customers while cursing as if no one could hear. After a staff member screwed up my order, she screamed at me that I was to blame and she was too busy to help and it wasn't her problem. Her supervisor did not help the situation. \n\nNeedless to say, I am happy that I do not frequent Charlotte enough to be tempted by their great pizza as I refuse to give them another one of my hard earned dollars due to their awful service.

But I do enjoy an occasional pizza pie, & Fuel just isn't impress me all that much.\n\nI've eaten at this Fuel in downtown Charlotte for late night several times & the place is always packed. They're open after the bars close, so expect some long lines full of boozed up late nighters. And unlike some other late night options in Charlotte, Fuel takes quite a while to get your order placed, & then you have to wait again to actually get your food. This whole line/wait can take from 20 min up.\n\nOnce you get to the front of line, they have a lot of pizza topping options, from your basics to some odd ones. Along with pizza slice choices, they also have garlic knots which actually may be better than the pizza. When you finally do get your food, the pizza is nothing special, especially considering your wait. To me, it's just your average, run of the mill pizza.\n\nI'd much rather have a different late night meal than pizza, but I still don't think their pizza is worth the wait. But if you really do crave pizza after bar hopping, then head to Fuel Pizza for a lengthy wait to satisfy your pizza hunger.", "type": "review", "business_id": "e8kqqWU9247Nn5VAF5sDkQ"}

Where is the gasoline smell? I mean, if they want to go all the way authentic they should just put in a gas pump. Heck, that would draw in plenty of people!\nWe were the first ones there.. which was good because about 3 minutes later the line was out the door, literally. We each got a slice. I kept it plain, what can I say.. I'm a pizza minimalist. You can really tell a lot about a pizza place by the way a slice of cheese pizza tastes.. and this is.. average. Although I do love the thin crust I'm lost with the amount of grease. The sauce is good, not to sweet, but the cheese is sparse and knowing what you can get else ware makes it less worthwhile.\nI'd say this would be a good place to crash in a drunken stupor but for my sober days I'll head out to Rosario's in Concord.

For dessert I had the panna cotta. It was not impressive. The presentation was nice but it had no flavor.

The bean stuff was okay but it didn't make up for the lackluster dry bread. I expect so much more from a good Italian. Then we ordered the cheese plate and a sausage plate.   We only raved about one cheese. All of the hard salami choices were good, but it is hard to mess-up that. \n\nThen came the worst main courses ever!  We ordered the pasta because we had heard such great reviews. I had the gnocchi and my friend had the ravioli. The pasta itself was good, but the sauce ruined everything. We can only describe the sauce as a thin tasteless substance with a hint of the flavor that comes out of a can of Chef Boyardee. I only ate bit of this gruel. We called for the check.

Ever.  Definitely more a bar - though the business name here is \"tavern\", they have a sign that says \"deli\".  I'm not sure I'd call them a deli.  Not by a long shot.  They have food, and they even have subs, but a deli?  I don't think so.  You go to a deli, and you expect a fat greasy guy named Tony to slice some meat and slap it on a roll.  Not some coed to take all your money.\n\nNonetheless, we were there hanging out - with the kids, actually - after I gave blood prior to the Zombie Walk.  Decided to get a bite since we picked up a discount due to the blood drive.  There is a tiny little area for dining if you don't want the total bar vibe.  And when I say tiny, I mean tiny.  I think it was one table.\n\nThe rest of the place is really a bar.  Or tavern if you want to feel more upscale.\n\nService wasn't too hot.  Or maybe it was hot if you're into that scene.  But it wasn't very good.  They were nice enough and all, but they were definitely not into serving a family of four food - they were wanting to get back to the bar (tavern, sorry) side and generate some better tips.\n\nDespite a proclamation on the menu that they had been rated \"uptown's best burgers\", I wasn't all that impressed.  Maybe I'm burgered out.  It wasn't bad, but like many places they let it cook too long.  Some of the rest of the family enjoyed it, but ultimately we decided that they liked the grease, not the juice (and there is a difference!).  The meat itself was dry - anyone can get greasy burgers.  It's more of a challenge to make it tasty and juicy.\n\nSweet Tea Report: Blech.  Possibly the worst in town.  I have had unsweetened tea at places that was sweeter than this stuff.

I'm guessing because he didn't have to stay or work in the Hotel itself.\n\nUnfortunately, that's where the good stuff ends.\n\nThe gym facilities are atrocious. 2 Treadmills, a recumbant bike, and an Elliptical machine with maybe 4 medicine balls littered around a room that measures 6 ft x 20ft, if that. A grotesque pool with a grimey bottom that on more than one occasion I considered drowning myself in to free myself from my mortal shackles and break free from this prison of a hotel.\n\nConcierge wasn't helpful at all -- when I arrived at the front desk and asked if I could score a bottle of water to use the gym, because I didn't feel like paying the $4.00 fee for drinking the Fiji water they had in my room, the guy at the front desk stuck up his nose and snootily informed me \"You can purchase water from the gift shop.\" Sorry buddy, at over $150 bucks per night, you can *give* me a water for the cost of... free. Also, what kind of idiot buys bottled water as a gift?\n\nThe in House internet is the slowest you will find.

Strike one. Urban center, so there is apt to be street noise that can permeate the rooms, and there was quite a bit of this - emergency vehicle sirens, loud auto sounds.  Strike two. The hotel is not well insulated from outside sounds.  The room doors and the rooms themselves are not designed to contain noise so it does not effect others.  I could easily hear even not loud conversations in adjacent rooms on both sides as well as guests speaking not too loudly in the halls, even after 1am.  I got precious few hours sleep that night!.  Strike three, and they're OUT was the obtrusively loud plumbing sounds.  When adjacent rooms used their facilities, whether it was the toilet, sink or shower/bath, I do not know.  I just know that it created a roaring sound in MY room.\n\nWhen I mentioned this to the desk person the next morning, she acknowledged each of my stated concerns, indicating that this is just the way it is at this property.\n\nIn addition, for anyone in need of ready and waiting cabs, this is another negative for this property.  I requested a cab pick-up for 5:50am, and was assured one would be there and waiting.  As you may have guessed, this did not happen.  Despite their best effort, no cab was there.  About 10 minutes later, one arrived, but it is somehow unsettling when one is on a tight schedule and relies on punctuality.  Of course, I built in some fudge factor so I did not go nuts, but if you need reliance on either waiting cabs at-the-ready or reliable pre-arranged on-call cabs, you might be sorely disappointed in what this hotel can assure.\n\nOn the plus side, their FREE Internet in the room was quite fast, measured at about 9Mbps down and up.  This was a pleasant surprise.", "type": "review", "business_id": "cBoFcjuNaWDQ2MP7GgeSBA"}

Or maybe you're a gansta who dresses like CiLo Green and wants to show the hunny's (yes, a group of them out with one man) a night on the town.  Or maybe you are a group of ladies who can't figure out why the Bravo TV Channel passed Charlotte over for the next cast of Real Housewives?  If you fall into any of these three categories, this is the joint for you.\n\nIn all honesty, I have seen all three scenarios mentioned above play out during each of the three times I've been to this restaurant (as for the third scenario, there must have been a Real Housewives convention or something in town...there were no fewer than 5 tables of cougars decked to the 9's trying to impress SOMEone....)\n\nThe food is good, not great.  Their steaks are great cuts of meat, but I can get their roasted chicken off the rotisserie at Harris Teeter, and their fish is always dry.  I won't harp on their oysters, as it was out-of-season when I got them, and that's not a fair shake, but still....No Bueno.  Go for the top tier steak...steer clear of apps. and other proteins.\n\nThe service, managers, and hostesses here are all as pretentious as the surroundings.  Funny story; my friends got turned away due to the places dress code.  They weren't given that reason, but come on...they walked into an empty restaurant, were given elevator eyes by the hostess, and were told that all the empty tables had \"reservations attached to them\".  And we are not talking bums off the street here...this was a Brooks Brothers and TRCW wearin' couple!  Bottom line...leave the jeans at home for this place...may even want to throw on a jacket to improve your chances with St. Peter at the Pearly Gates...I mean, the hostess at the podium.\n\nOverall, if you feel the need to define your restaurant experience by how much you spend, and the number of \"important\" people sitting next to you, go here.  If you want good food, and don't feel like taking out a second mortgage on your home to enjoy a nice meal, pass on this one.  As far as high-end steakhouses go, might I suggest Ruth's Chris (right down the street) or Del Friscos (South Park) as better alternatives to this place?  Del Frisco's is my personal choice, due to the fact that I always see Ric Flair here, and he entertains me...WOOOOO!", "type": "review", "business_id": "CChwRoYVXA3QZulS8a6xOQ"}

I really enjoy The Capital Grill most times and this experience left a poor taste for the Charlotte location. Our service and the food was, at best, two-star. I know I did not have the steak but typically I can count on this chain to deliver a good meal - if not great (my last visit in Downers Grove, IL in December was fabulous).\n\nWhen we were told we could not get a table for an hour we decided to sit at the bar.  After about 15 minutes the host said he could seat us - we should have been suspicious at this point. We went outside to our table that had trash and leaves around the edges of the patio (hey, wait they didn't just blow there last night).  Our tablecloth had stains and spots on the silverware. \n\nIt took a good 15-20 minutes for our server to come take an order after bread and water were dropped. We asked to start with the fresh mozzarella, tomato, and basil with 12-year aged balsamic. When it arrived it was two neat stacks on one plate and one empty plate. When we asked the server why it was not split his response was \"we can't split this salad.\" Ok - not as if we asked to split an escargot- the salad was almost perfectly portioned for two. Not to bother we just shared. The sliced tomatoes were mealy and flavorless and only one leaf of basil per stack. There was a nice marinated grape tomato as a garnish but I didn't pay for a tasty garnish. \n\nThe main course we tried the grouper special. I've had better. The grouper was ok (notice the theme) but the shrimp that came with the special was overlooked and tough. Our sides - saut\u00e9ed spinach and the wild mushrooms were good. We ordered a 1/2 order of both which is just perfect for two people. My only comment is we pulled eight whole cloves of garlic out of the spinach before eating it. Vampires beware ,,,\n\nOur drinks were never tended too and the front server never bothered to follow up on the salad.

I thought is would be a very nice meal and someplace I had not taken them before.  Eating in the best restaurants in town and when we travel is not unusual.  The food was very hit-and-miss and so was the service.  \n\nLet's start with the food.  We ordered two appetizers for the table that were not part of restaurant week.  The Calamari and the Mozzarella wrapped cheese.  The calamari was excellent and cooked perfectly.  The Mozzarella was good but not the tastiest or smoothest mozzarella I have eaten.  Both were worthy.  For the first course, my oldest son had the clam chowder which he enjoyed.  The rest of us ordered the mixed field greens salad which was awful.  I have had a better side salad at Wendy's.  It was totally tasteless and un-inspired.  None of us even finished half the portion.  When the waiters helper asked if we were done, we told him to please take them away and how horrible they were.  The three men had the filet for our main course.  It was a very middle of the road filet.  I am not sure if they lowered their quality for restaurant week but it tasted no better than an Outback Steak.  Even my 15 year old recognized the poor quality of meat.  My wife had the Salmon which was better than the filet but nothing exciting.  She only ate half the portion and it was not worth packing up to take home.  The mashed potato side was amazing and the creamed spinach side was average.  The creme brulee and flourless chocolate cake for desert were both amazing.  I would recommend just hitting the bar for these late night after a show.  \n\nThe service was also only marginal.  A big let down compared to the service received at lunch.  The waiter reached across the table versus walking around, and he plated the food close but not just right so you had to re-arrange the positioning of every dish before eating it.  The atmosphere is beautiful.  I would return for a business lunch but don't waste your time or money on dinner or taking someone you want to impress.", "type": "review", "business_id": "CChwRoYVXA3QZulS8a6xOQ"}

At Capital Grille in Charlotte, to my surprise and disappointment, I got a $60 bill and an unseasoned, tasteless steak to show for it.

I ended up using the bleu for my mashed potatoes which made those a total hit! \n\nBut to goto a fancy shmancy steakhouse where you (or your company) is charged an arm and a leg and they can't even properly cook your steak for you is just criminal.

I guess likeable for those who really just want chips.  We asked for extra salsa (and were charged I believe 50 cents extra for each tiny tub, woof!) to make it more pleasing.  Most of us got sandwiches, which sounded really good on the menu.  And in fact my philly style chicken sandwich was tasty enough... as long as I bit into a part that had cheese on it.  It was grilled chicken, peppers, carmelized onions and provolone on a bun.  But again, it was just a bit on the dry side, and there wasn't enough cheese on it to mask that.  One of my tablemates asked if she could get a dipped sandwich - the waitress seemed confused, so I guess they don't do that so much down here, but for anyone else who is confused that's dipping the whole sandwich into whatever juicy drippings came off of the meat on the sandwich.

I've found that Pittsburgh locals are super fun! I absolutely loved how everyone cheered the singers on during karaoke and sang along making it extremely comfortable to get up front and center! \n- Healthy food choices! Instead of having to worry about adding a ridiculous amount of calories (in addition to the crazy amount I had already consumed for the day)...it was nice to snack on some hummus, fresh tomatoes, feta cheese, and pita bread. \n- Very friendly DJ!\n- Bartenders were simply wonderful and always made sure you were taken care even with the enormous bar crowd.\n- Prices were very reasonable. I think I had six or seven captain and cokes (blush) and the platter for only $20?!\n\nDislikes: \n- POLLUTED AIR. I now have to take my jacket to the dry cleaner, thank you. \n- Location. There were no available taxis at any given time. We contacted two different taxi services and they never showed. We finally had a taxi pick us up after calling the hotel valet and asking them to send for us (I was a little desperate).\n- This place is very, very, very small. The karaoke room was closed off by 11 PM due to the room being so packed. If you were not in the karaoke room, you were smelling the person next to you's breath. \n\nAside the heavy smoke and tight spaces, I would recommend Nico's for a fun night of karaoke and cheap drinks with friends!", "type": "review", "business_id": "tQpYnf3P3Q_OQLYYJvlV-A"}

So, when I came back to the 'Burgh for a visit he was all about finding a Vietnamese place in the city to get some more. \n\nMy parents and I had spent the afternoon in the Strip District, and enjoyed a few beers at Roland's before heading over to Tram's for dinner. We were hungry and the portions were huge, tasty and the reasonably priced. We decided to get three different entrees and all share. Obviously, we got the pho with beef, the fresh spring rolls, a spicy/bbq shrimp plate that came with white rice, and a vermicelli bowl with pork. \n\nEverything was pretty tasty. The pho broth was a little salty for my preference, but it had a wonderful lemongrass aroma and taste. Also, usually I get fried or garlic rice with any rice dish I order from my favorite place in Cali, but the shrimp was very good and not at all over-coooked, as so many places do these days. The vermicelli dish was right on, and other than the fact that I prefer egg rolls to spring rolls, those were tasty as well, especially with the dipping sauce they provided.\n\nI'd give this place 3 and a half stars. It was, overall, a good dining experience and service was quick, despite the neighborhood being a little sketchy and the inside being a little divey. \n\nAlso, a personal comment. I firmly believe pho is a miracle cure for the cold/flu. Anytime I get sick I head over to my pho place and order a huge bowl with beef and then add plenty of Siracha sauce. I always wake up the next day feeling like a million bucks.  So, if you're feeling sick (especially around this time of year) try it out.

I give it kudos for the jukebox on the tables (Sopranos finale style) and I thought our server was great.  She easily had been doing this for 40+ years.  The atmosphere is good just like any other diner you would go too.  I was here this morning with my friend Fiona and we both needed a hearty breakfast to help with our recovery from the prior night.  The coffee was good and plentiful.  We never had less than half a cup.  I had two poached eggs and white toast.  The eggs were poached perfectly and the bread was appropriately soaked with butter.  All in all this was pretty good.  My bacon was also fine with three healthy strips.  However, Fiona was less lucky.  She had a veggie omelette which was average at best, size doesn't matter with respect to omelettes I'd rather less eggs, but super beaten so the omelette is light.  The veggies were plentiful, but I'd prefer the veggies lightly sauteed, so texturely there isn't such a difference from the eggs to the vegetables.  The sausage was good, but cold.  She asked for crispy bacon and it wasn't crispy at all, in fact it was exactly the same doneness as mine.  The homefries were okay, but I prefer a little more crust on the potatoes.  I'd say this is a perfectly acceptable diner, but I'd recommend you'll enjoy your meal much better if it's at 2 AM in the morning as opposed to 10 AM on a saturday when most of your whits are about you and your palate is not dulled from the Tequila.", "type": "review", "business_id": "--UE_y6auTgq3FXlvUMkbw"}

It's my firm opinion that any business that serves customers on a walk-in basis should be open 24/7.  I mean, yeah, there's that circadian rhythm thing that keeps every business from having the graveyard shift, but I'm sure we're only a couple decades away from curing the need for sleep.  Point is, Ritter's is 24 hours, and as a result it's been a standby ever since I moved into town.\n\nThe food at Ritter's is definitely better than what you'll get at a Denny's or a King's.  It isn't top-shelf, artisan food, but it is pretty good diner food.  Ritter's is also a great place to go hang out with a few friends late at night, and BS over coffee when you're just not feeling going to a bar and blowing mad cash on drinks.  Or for stopping by after you've already blown your mad drink cash.\n\nThe waitresses are nice.  The fellah who usually rings us out was really rude to me at least once.  I think he was the owner or manager or something, too.  But I'm not really sure.\n\nThe place is cash-only, too, which sucks.  However, the fact that they're cash-only leads to a really encouraging story about the place: one time the ATM did something wacky and I thought I may have been charged without having received my cash.  The waitress took down my name and phone number, which I thought was just to get me to stop complaining, but sure enough someone called me the next day and gave me the run-down on what had happened.  I'd call that good service.\n\nIf it's late and you're peckish, don't forget that Ritter's is open.", "type": "review", "business_id": "--UE_y6auTgq3FXlvUMkbw"}

Ritters represents 3AM with your friends, not because anyone is particularly hungry for chicken tenders, but because the bars are closed and no one is ready to go home quite yet. The laughter and fun shared at late night at Ritters can be replaced by nothing else. If you are looking for awesome food, you will be disappointed.

It is so awesome to see all of the club goers pile into Ritters after dancing on a dark dance floor....hair a mess, mascara looking more like a raccoon than the model they were just a few hours ago and limping in those fierce heels they thought looked SO cute when they hit the dance floor.

IMHO, if you added some ground chuck you would get even better flavor but overall they have some of the best tasting burger meat out there.\n\nThey cook on a griddle that is heated by burning hard woods, an interesting concept but to be honest I could not taste any smokiness to the meat. Also, IMHO, grilled meat tastes better, but griddled meat is juicer.\n\nThe burgers are served on what appears to be a Portuguese style bun, rather plain tasting they add very little to the burger itself. Toppings are simple lettuce, tomato, onions, etc. Their goal is to highlight the meat and not cover it up with lots of toppings or sauces.\n\nOn the side I had the home-fries, which they suggested, and to be honest they were disgustingly gross. Overcooked lumps of potato and onions saturated in grease that not only looked bad but didn't taste very good either.\n\nI like the ambience of the local burger joint, but thought a burger for $ 9.00 was pretty spendy. Service was good.\n\nBottom Line:\n\nSome of the best meat that I've had in a burger, it was cooked perfectly and very juicy - skip those home fires (yuck).\n \nIf you are burger purist, enjoying a plain all American hamburger with nothing fancy you will love Tessaro's, if however, you like a more complicated burger with lots of dressings / sauces and complex toppings you will find Tessaro's lacking.\n\nSo why three stars? 1 off for the home fires and 1 off for not grilling the burger over that hardwood.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vgXE1I7c9ElcfYyZfQiN1Q"}

Prior to that, I'd eat there about four times a year.  I guess I was worried about what the new management would do to a Pittsburgh tradition.  \n\nMy fears were relatively unfounded.  Tessaro's is still  the same warm, local and friendly place it's been for decades.  The new ownership retained everything that mattered -- and a few things that are problematic.\n\nI need to say that I'm a steak fan.  Good steak.  So I'm always just a BIT disappointed because the steaks at Tessaro's have too much gristle.  My friends, however, always order the burgers and they swear by them.  \n\nWhat continues to disappoint me are the little things.  The bread is NEVER fresh.  It always feels and tastes a few days old.  The salads also taste packaged.  The vegetable side dishes are limp.  I once commented about this to my server at Tessaro's.  Her reply?  \"Oh, honey, this is a bar-and-grill, not a fine dinin' establishment!\"  I laughed and had to agree.\n\nSo go for the burgers.  Get the potato sides.  Have a good cold beer to go with it and you won't be disappointed.  \n\nI see others say that the tables are too tightly packed and you overhear others' conversations.  That's one of the features of a place like this.  It's like one big family meal where you're always meeting new family members.  \n\nOne rule I've come to live by, though:  \"Never order fish/seafood in a steak place and never order steak in a fish/seafood restaurant.\"  That applies to Tessaro's too.  My wife has NEVER had a decent fish entree at Tessaro's.  Not a slam, but an acknowledgment that you can't be everything to everybody.  \n\nA nod of thanks to the \"new\" ownership for keeping the place comfortable and friendly.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vgXE1I7c9ElcfYyZfQiN1Q"}

Peculiar that they offer the bleu cheese wet or dry. Guessing the wet is bleu cheese dressing and I like my bleu cheese straight up, so easy decision. Side of coleslaw for me, fries for hubby. \n\nWe both remarked that we expected it to taste better than it did. The bleu cheese had no flavor, the bacon was barely noticeable and I had to add ketchup to it to get anything going on.

I finally decided tonight that I had to try it for myself.\n\nWhile the food is above average, the ambiance does leave a little to be desired. The evening started out with a bread basket, which was (oddly) comprised of three somewhat bland pieces of white bread and about 20 little squares of butter. Very strange. Even in my most gluttonous days, I find it impossible to average 6+ squares of butter per slice of bread, but maybe that's just me.\n\nMy dish, the linguini with house-made cream sauce and mushrooms, came with a soup or salad, of which I chose the broccoli and cheddar soup. As a vegetarian, I was pleased to see plenty of options on the menu for me to choose from. The broccoli and cheddar soup was rich and creamy, albeit a bit salty for my taste. The linguini however, was great. I could immediately tell the sauce was homemade - it had a certain fresh and rich flavor that pre-packaged sauce tends to lack. (Unfortunately, I'm sure the amount of calories I consumed in that dish reflected the amazingly rich flavor, but I'll just ignore that.) As pleased as I was with my own menu luck, I found my boyfriend's dish - the gnocchi with pomodoro sauce - to be a tad bit lackluster. The pomodoro sauce and the gnocchi itself were forgettable. While I loved my own dish, the lack of consistency throughout the menu makes ordering a bit difficult.\n\nOverall, this is a pretty good neighborhood Italian restaurant that is priced rather decently.

However, I find that kind of charming -- I imagine all of the steel workers of yore, boots dirty and hands ragged, gathering at the local watering hole after a long day's work to unwind with their neighbors and enjoy a cold pint and some good food.\n\nAnyway, I digress. I've been to the Pleasure Bar several times, and I have always left relatively satisfied. I've never encountered any service issues, and the food has always been decent. Now don't get me wrong -- the food isn't super modern, light, amazing Italian cuisine. It is, however, good \"Pittsburgh Italian\" --  and by that I mean that many of their dishes are heavier, richer, and more dense. Yes, I just made up the term \"Pittsburgh Italian\", but for a city that puts french fries on its salads, I think it fits. For example, one of their more popular and delicious appetizers is their potato balls -- as the name suggests, these are deep fried balls of mashed potatoes. Delightfully crispy on the outside, and warm, smooth and creamy on the inside. Their gnocchi is delicious, but very dense -- it's not the light, pillow-y type of gnocchi that some other Italian restaurants serve. That being said, I have no problem with starchy, dense gnocchi. I often get it tossed with mafalda sauce, which is one of their signature sauces that is a combination of marinara and alfredo. Sinful!!  So yeah, their food is the type of food that is rich and delicious, but you're definitely not going to be running a 5k after eating it (then again, running a 5k is overrated anyway ;) ) \n\nSo for what it is, I think Pleasure Bar's food is actually pretty good. However, the last three times that I've visited, I've had -- hmm, how to say this politely? -- \"intestinal issues.\"  The first time it happened, I thought maybe it was a fluke, but then I went again a few weeks later, and once again it was a gastrointestinal race to the finish home. I gave it one final try, but met the same fate.  So there is clearly something about their food that doesn't agree with me (and for the record, this doesn't ever happen anywhere else). To be fair though, it's very possible that my body is just weird, because in all cases my dining partners have not gotten ill.\n\nSo I'm kind of torn -- my brain wants to give Pleasure Bar 4 stars, maybe 4.5, because I really do like their food. But my GI tract wants to give them a 1 or a 2. So I'll split the difference and go with 3.", "type": "review", "business_id": "-Nanlb7SYXObqQ6dZ49UOg"}

It cost about an extra $20 a day to park at the Courtyard Marriott.  The good thing is that the valet guys were super nice.  Plus they have a complimentary shuttle bus that will take you almost anywhere.\n\nThe rooms were nothing to rave about.  Clean.  Simple.  Just a place to sleep.  The layout of the room was a little strange.  I am not used to having the bed face the window but it was comfortable enough that it didn't faze me.\n\nAnytime I ran into staff, they seemed friendly and one even held the elevator for us just because she could hear our flip-flops coming down the hallway.\n\nBreakfast here was a little chaotic and also another way of stealing your money.  I ended up paying $11 for a piece of toast, a croissant, and tea.  Initially, I had ordered a breakfast meal because I never can use buffets to their full potential.  However, there were only 2 waitresses and of course, our waitress had forotten to put in my order.  I walked up to her and just said that I would switch over to continental breakfast.

On a side note, we didn't leave the party until 2am so this ended up being a stellar idea. The hotel is centrally located, convenient to UPMC Shadyside, CMU,Pitt,etc. We actually walked to and from the party which was right on Walnut Street (the main shopping street in the Shadyside District) and it was only about a 7 minute walk. The parking is valet ONLY (I understand why due to the fact the parking lot could easily be used by non-guests if it wasn't valet), however it's $17.88/day, which in my opinion is a bit steep for Pittsburgh. The lobby is very nice and there is a Starbucks inside as well. I also noticed there is a pool for anyone with kiddies (or anyone that brought a swimsuit!). Customer service at check-in was very friendly, being rewards members we were asked what floor we would like and if we would like a balcony, and we also found out there is a complimentary shuttle that goes at least to Shadyside if not further. \n\nNow when we got to the room, it was, well, average. We had a king size bed, a tiny sofa and coffee table, a flatscreen tv. We were not going to be using the room really so the fact it was not as nice as other hotels we have recently stayed in was ok. There was free wifi in the room which is always a plus. Another drawback in my opinion was the fact that the sink area was outside of the bathroom. It was also a tight squeeze and we had to take turns using that area. A minor, slightly annoying inconvenience was all that was really. Now the other drawback was the price. Our room for one night was $245!!! The room was clearly not a $245/night room nor was the hotel in general. We most recently stayed at a Boutique hotel (The Tudor Arms Doubletree in Cleveland) and that was between $150-$170/night as I recall, and it was MUCH more nicely furnished and with better amenities than the Courtyard. Now because we agreed to split this $245, I wasn't as astonished about the price, however, this is Pittsburgh, one night at the Courtyard should NOT be $245! I am doubting I will have a need to stay here again in the future, however, it is important to note they are building a Hilton right across the street from the Courtyard so possibly there will be some price competition when that opens and anyone in the future does not need to pay an arm and a leg to stay here.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DiPbxquQQHSgz123I27Drg"}

Yes, I've never met a non-greasy fried zucchini strip, but these are saturated and almost taste like they came out of a bag pre-breaded. Definitely lacking that hand-breaded aspect. The chicken nachos were made with seemingly-stale tortilla chips and were so bland that I actually left more than half of the plate uneaten. That's a rarity for me, a self-proclaimed nacho addict. I've also tried the cheese wedges and the chicken tenders. The cheese wedges are another product that seems so simple to pull off, yet they come out cold and greasy.

The reviews looked good, why not give BSS a try. Baby in tow, I walked over in the heat and called a friend to meet me there. When I walked into BSS, I froze in terror. How is it possible that all of the reviews do not mention that this place looks like it hasn't been cleaned since it opened. Yikes. The floors were a mess, the chair cushions were torn and the staff don't seem to even notice nor do the customers. That may have something to do with the food but more on that later. I was pleasantly greeted by an older woman, Ma Roz I assume. She sent someone in the back to dig out a highchair and specifically asked him to clean it. Well, it came out about half clean with some hairs on it. Nothing wet ones couldn't handle. My friend arrived shorty and she was just as shocked as I was. Well, I was committed at this point so we were going to give it a try. We both decided on breakfast. I ordered the pancakes with a side of bacon. There are some interesting pancake mix ins to note such as marshmallow, thin mints and chocolate chip cookies. I decided to go with peaches and blueberries. It didn't take long for our food to arrive. My pancakes looked incredible though they were missing one thing, whipped cream. Not a problem, they easily remedied that situation. I took my first bite and ta da! The light bulb went on. I suddenly understood why locals would keep coming back to this place despite the decor- if you want to call it that. They quite possibly could have been the best pancakes I have ever eaten. The fruit was fresh. That's right, FRESH peaches. Not canned stuff like you might assume for a small establishment such as this. The bacon was also cooked to perfection. They definitely know how to do it right here. And the prices were very reasonable. $4.50 for 3 pancakes, or should I say heaven cakes, and only $.50 a mix in.  I think they may only accept cash here so, you may want to head to the ATM first. Although, I was shocked and quite honestly, taken aback by the decor of BSS, I was also blown away by the quality of the food.

I ordered the create-your-own pasta with mafalda pasta, gorgonzola basil cream sauce, and chicken.  The sauce was actually quite tasty, although a bit on the strong side, and overpowered the chicken quite a bit.  It was definitely unique, however!  The bread that was served with the pasta was thick and soft, but wasn't particularly unique.  Service was fine, and the atmosphere was nice.  Overall, not a bad option for Italian food in Bloomfield, and I'd go back if a dining companion wanted to try it, but I wouldn't go out of my way to return since there's better Italian to be had elsewhere in PGH.  3.5 stars.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5MChfa-jZfMo3vBpolkSbw"}

Famous.\nTom's Diner in NYC? Famous - if only because of Jerry Seinfeld and Suzanne Vega.\nSammys? ...to... ...Pittsburghers...? \n\nBut none of my pals had ever eaten at Sammy's. Sure, they'd driven by and read the signs, but they'd never gotten off their duffs and had a go at this 'famous' corned beef. So I decided to do it myself. \n\nHere's how it went:\n\nMy corned beef sandwich featured (drum roll, please): corned beef (!!!), Swiss cheese, rye bread, sauerkraut, and Russian dressing. I double-checked my notes on corned beef sandwiches I had previously consumed in my lifetime. ALL THE INGREDIENTS WERE THE SAME. So, I asked myself: what makes Sammy's corned beef famous? \n\n1. It's not the corned beef. I mean, it was good corned beef, but it wasn't life-changing. I certainly wouldn't challenge another deli to a Corned Beef Showdown with Sammy's in my corner.\n2. It's not the Swiss cheese. I'm pretty sure that Swiss cheese served in Switzerland would be vastly superior. \n3. Maybe it's the bread. Most rye bread is thin. Sammy's has thick rye bread. And it's soft. Very pleasant.\n4. It's not the sauerkraut. My German grandmother whips up a mean sauerkraut, the kind her mom made in the Old Country 50+ years ago. Sammy's isn't anything to sneeze at.\n5. It's not the Russian dressing. Can anyone stake a claim in truly superlative Russian dressing? Maybe the Russians. But not Sammy.\n\nIt seems that I'm bashing Sammy, but I'm not. I just don't think it was anything special. I enjoyed my sandwich, but I might have enjoyed more the conversation I was having whilst eating the sandwich. \n\nMaybe, Sammy, you're famous for claiming you're famous. \n\nThat's how Paris Hilton achieved fame, so you're in good company. \n\nI think.", "type": "review", "business_id": "YDCxBTJmF-lLCk1Qx8vDfg"}

The order was received correctly, however my tofu pad thai just tasted a bit bland.  Not sure they got the sauce right or something.  It's not that it wasn't edible, it just wasn't very tasty.  Kind of meh, if you will.\n\nFast forward 3 weeks later when my co-workers and I went out to eat at the restaurant this time around.  The service was decent and the food was fantastic.  I had the spicy noodles which was a great mix of thick noodles, veggies and tofu.  Just a couple of critiques:  I think it's stupid that they charge you $1 extra per person for BYOB.  Also, their policy which states no separate checks for parties of 5 or more, is kind of annoying.  Otherwise, I'd consider eating here if you're in the area.

As usual, the French onion was pretty darn good and warranted no complaints - but my main course, not so much; after reviewing the menu, I thought, \"A steak hoagie? With lettuce, tomato, and cheese, plus mushrooms if I ask? Heck yes!\" Turns out despite the menu promising most of the toppings off the bat, either the cook forgot or someone new made my hoagie. It was just meat, cheese and mushrooms, all on a rather tasteless hoagie bun. Bleh. That sandwich was barely touched at the table. I did take it home in the hopes of improving it for later meals. And if nothing else, I did get a pile of french fries with my hoagie, and Getaway Cafe remains the master of the perfect french fry!\n\nI haven't lost all hope, especially since I went with a friend who had what looked like a really good pasta special.

The Gyro was indeed huge and the meat was flavorful but the veggies were close to the end of their shelf life. The fries that came with the meal were crap actually, I know that they are fresh cuts fries so lets make sure that they are cooked all the way through and have some sort of uniformity in size and the oil that they were fried in was obviously fairly old. The fries were on a greasiness level of their own. I have never had such soggy fries. \n\nThe service was certainly some of the most friendly I have had in sometime and the proce for the Gyro combo really is hard to beat it came in right around $6.

She boxed it up and then we asked her to give us 12 assorted cookies, bakers choice but no nuts.\n\nFeeling happy about our current collection, I happened upon what appeared to be an apple purse.

They were fresh and good.  I particularly like the oatmeal raisin that she put in and the mint chocolate chip tree was the most unusual one.  After my fourth cookie, the box was removed from my hands and I was told that I couldn't have any more until after dinner.  That is not made-up.\n\nAfter having eaten some of the cake and the apple dumpling, I must say that I will return.

I had been wanting to try Pitaland since I first saw it on the boulevard and was excited to finally make it there.  Whenever we finally made it inside, it was not what I had expected but in a good way.  The store was super clean, bright and open with an olive bar, central aisle of grocery items, deli and then a food counter with bar seats.  They also have some tables outside so that you eat there if the weather is nice.\n\nFor my lunch entree I decided to go with the chicken shawarma in the donor size while my father went with the gyro in donor size.  While we were ordering I noticed a rather clever tip jar sign that had something to do with \"pita\" spelled backwards.  After placing our order we decided to sit inside at the counter on this day since the sun and humidity outside would have made for a miserable experience.  After only a few minutes of waiting, our lunches were handed over to us.  My chicken shwarma came out to me on a large pita with lettuce, pickle, onion, tomato and what I think was a a garlic mayo sauce?  The size of the pita was pretty large and I knew that by the time I was finished that I wouldn't need anything else.  Sadly I was disappointed with the sandwich and that mainly had to do with the chicken.  Since it was done rotisserie style I thought that meant that the meat would be good and moist.  However, it ended up being super dry and seemed to be overcooked as well.  The rest of the sandwich ended up being good though and I really enjoyed the larger pickles that were in my pita.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I might head back here again in the future.

We went here while visiting Pittsburgh to celebrate a birthday.\n\nThe restaurant is small, seating is quite close together, and noise level is probably a little high to carry on a meaningful conversation without your table neighbor overhearing all the details.\n\nI think we may have been a bit under dressed. I would say \"snappy casual\" would have appropriate. We were not looking quite that snappy.\n\nAnyway, we ordered an antipasta platter with cured meat, cheese, olives, fava bean spread, and some roasted veggies. Pair that with an excellent bottle of red wine. It was amazing! Surely enough food there for both of us to eat for dinner but we wanted to try the pizza.\n\nUnfortunately, less than 10 min after our huge appetizer came out our server delivered the pizza to our tiny table where there wasn't any more room and we were clearly not ready for the next part of our meal. So, we let the pizza sit there.\n\nWhen we got ready to eat the pizza it was cold and the crust was rubbery. When our server returned we explained the trouble with the pizza and he promptly got us a fresh one. This was a very nice gesture and promptly rectified the fact he never should have delivered the first one when he did.\n\nThe crust on the second pizza was still rubbery. The platter and wine were by far the best part of the meal. Overall the evening was enjoyable but I don't think I would order the pizza again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6-rJjW6ITl5o_FliiNgZRA"}

I got their Linguini vongole which was done perfectly and my brother's daily special (bucatini with braised pork) tasted fabulous. The ambiance is ok - it's romantic but definitely a bit too noisy but what do you expect out of a space so small. As nice as my waiter was, they didn't time our foods right (brought entrees out while we were still eating our appetizers) and they started to cleared the table when not everyone at the table was finished.  This wasn't that big of a deal but when you're at a trendy restaurant, you expect a bit more than what you'd see at the Olive Garden. Also, if you get annoyed with yuppy moms who bring their newborns and 3 yr old kids that 'behave really well', this place will get on your nerves. I got cut in line placing my name in for a table by some lady who felt entitled to cut in front of the several other ppl waiting bc she had a baby with her. Then I went to the back bar area where half the bar stool seating and the sofa sitting area was being taken up by children under 4 and baby carriages.

Lebanon is such a cute little town! I was so happy we chose to eat dinner there, especially when we got a great, people-watching table right next to the window. Very relaxing before our 5-hour drive home the next day.\n\nIl Pizzaiolo has a great, rustic atmosphere. Dark wood, tan walls, delicious pizza smells. And a full bar. Very important.\n\nThe service was eh. It took the waitress at least 10 minutes to greet us and take our drink order, another 5 to get drinks and tepid water for the table. (Ew, chill the water. I know you're going for a Euro atmosphere but you're not in Europe. Chill the damn water.) The appetizer got there after another 5 and then the pizza took forever. I don't know how since the menu claims they're cooked in 30 seconds in the wood burning oven. But no matter. On to the review.\n\nT got a beer and I got a mimosa. They were out of the peach juice that usually goes in a mimosa so it was made with blood orange juice instead. Delicious. \n\nFor our appetizer we ordered a sort of potato stick with cheese mixed in. Forget the exact name and they don't seem to have a website where I can check. They were ... okay. A bit bland truth be told but the Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top helped a bit. There was no salt and pepper on the table and our waitress was a bit absent so we sucked it up and ate the bland potato stick things.\n\nHowever, the pizza improved a somewhat mediocre appetizer. We got the Diavolo with spicy salami and chili flakes. Amazing. The crust was thin and chewy and not too black on the bottom. The cheese was salty and creamy and the salami was spicy and really tasty. Much better than pepperoni in my opinion.\n\nI suppose it's a good spot if you're in the mood for Italian. I'm sure there are better in the Pittsburgh area.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6-rJjW6ITl5o_FliiNgZRA"}

There were several items that were really good, but yet there were a few areas that left a bad feeling in my mouth.\n\nThe arancini - the Sicilian and Neapolitan Fried Rice Balls - were top notch and I would get over and over.  There were four little fried balls of risotto that were so good.  We also had the insalata misticanza - which they graciously split in half for us.  It was your typical salad.\n\nWe then had the cavatelli con rapini - with sausage and rapini - as well as the bucatini all'amatriciana - with Guanciale and onions.  Both dishes had unique flavors.  However, the cavatelli came out luke warm and I had to send it back to be warmed.  It also had too much sausage - it more than dominated the pasta.\n\nSo - that's the food review.  As for the staff - it left a little to be desired.  First off - we had a reservation and I had requested an outside seating on the phone.  In essence, they told me they don't take reservations for the outside - it's first come first serve when you get there.  So - when we got to the restaurant I asked and they told me that it would be a good 30 minute wait.  So we sat inside.  Then after we ordered our drinks, I went to look at the patio b/c I had heard it was very nice...and there were several open tables.  I didn't understand where our 30 minute wait was.  Then when I get back to my table, I see the waitress seating a couple outside...who came in after us.  If it's first come first serve for the patio - how come it was a 30 minute wait for us, but not for the other couple?  I just felt that they might have catered to people who were their 'regulars'.  On top of that - our waitress wasn't always the most attentive.\n\nWhile the food was good (once it was warm), I'm not sure I would come back due to the other factors.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6-rJjW6ITl5o_FliiNgZRA"}

Nothing was overly amazing but the food was decent. Decor is your typical Tuscan style and the wood fire oven is interesting to watch. \n\nI had one of the veal dishes which reminded me a lot of Chicken Marsala and cost $28. There was no sides, salad and even bread to go with the meal but the size of my portion was ok. The only issue I had,  besides the high cost, was that my meal had no surprises.  It was a very simple dish and for $28 I would expect something more complex. The sauce was everywhere, overpowering the cheese, procuito and mushrooms and there was nothing to counter it. A vegetable or anything would have improved the meal and helped me get through the overwhelming taste of the sauce.  \n\nMy husband had the lasagna which was very good but cost $19 and I know it did not fill him up. Again it was simple in design and we were expecting something more coming from an Italian background.  Maybe my family is full of over-achievers, so my opinion may be harsh but for the type of food they are creating the price is outrageous. \n\nIf prices were lower my review would be higher and I say this with years of dining experience in Mt. Lebanon. For the same amout you would be better of going next door to Bistro 19, one of the upscale restaurants in the area. In my opinion they have a far better menu, it is creative,  hearty and the atmosphere is trendy. We went there this summer and I loved everything about the place.

My husband loves the fact that he can grab a Starbucks and relax in one of the many seating areas while I \"quickly\" browse the sale rack at Ann Taylor or Anthropologie.

How much more expensive? Enough that the Galleria is typically window shopping only for me...\n\nOn the plus side, the Galleria is a bit more upscale and beautiful than the South Hills Village by design, so at least while I'm window shopping I'm able to enjoy a lovely building and atmosphere! Although I really don't like driving in its parking lot; I often have to park in the underground segment of the lot and doing so kind of creeps out the claustrophobic in me.\n\nAnd in fairness there ARE some things in here I can afford and do enjoy going to. The Hibachi place here is pretty good, and it's hard to go wrong with a Panera or Starbucks stop. Other highlights for me include the delicious chocolate shop, happy hour at Houlihans, and (to break my food and drink theme) the Coldwater Creek store. I also love just sitting around the fountain they have in here...it brings back memories from when I was little and ran along the ledge of that very fountain. (Surprise surprise, I fell in once or twice...little me wasn't a well-behaved child sometimes.)\n\nStill, the good things here aren't enough to make me love the Galleria more than the South Hills Village mall space. There's no bookstore in the Galleria area, its movie theater is overpriced (especially considering the run-down state of the theater itself as of my last visit), and honestly I've had a bad experience with sales reps in a number of the stores here; many have been overly pushy in an obvious effort to boost their commission payments, to the point that they've tried to sell me items that don't even fit me properly.\n\nIf you're going to visit the Galleria, I say do it for the food. There are definitely some decent eateries here (I only mentioned a couple of them). As for the stores...if you're anything like me, have fun window shopping and be prepared to experience some sticker shock!", "type": "review", "business_id": "NaRkccIbBE3gt-3fne_bDA"}

I've never watched a movie there but the main attraction for this place was Anthropologie.  My wife loves that store and for the longest time it was the only one in all of Pittsburgh until we recently discovered there is one near Point Breeze at Bakery Square.\n\nBesides Anthropologie from what I can remember there's always been a Godiva and Restoration Hardware as well.  This mall is small and there's no department store.  I dont' really know what type of mall to call it because it's not like there are super high end stores here but there some good stores like Williams-Sonoma.  \n\nIt's hard to explain the true purpose of this mall because it's not like it is really complimented by surrounding strip malls or big box complexes kind of like how Robinson has the Summit etc.  Either way it has Anthropologie and that is why my wife always wants to come here when we are in PGH.", "type": "review", "business_id": "NaRkccIbBE3gt-3fne_bDA"}

I spend a lot of time there studying,  and I find the baristas (do they call people who work at coffee shops that aren't Starbucks that??) there to be just about the unhappiest lot I've ever encountered.  I try not to fault them TOO much for this, as I've worked retail before (though never food service, and I am completely aware that food service may very well be worse), and they probably deal with a lot of grade A d-bags (am I allowed to say that here?) in Shadyside.  But still.  I always go out of my way to be polite to them, and I come in nearly everyday, despite the coffee (which I agree is very 'meh'... watery and just basically pretty average, if not slightly below) and HORRIBLE pastries/desserts.  (Seriously, they taste like they've been around since the place opened.)  But never a flash of recognition, of any sort of 'hey this girl's usually pretty nice and polite so maybe when she quite benignly asks for a cup of ice in addition to her $4 iced soy-vanilla latte+tip, I shouldn't practically roll my eyes at her.'  Nothing like that.\n\nSo, why do I come here everyday?  For the same reason other people must come here, too... the people-watching and melding of inside/outsideness in the place.  It IS pretty lame that the internet isn't free, and especially with how Crazy Mocha has apparently hopped onboard with UPMC to takeover the city, you'd think CTR would at least want to keep up with the competition.  But, with a purchase, you still get 2 hours access, so that does go a bit of a ways in making up for it.\n\nIn terms of the wait for tables, I've never found it to be quite as bad as a few on here have said.  I've never had to wait longer than 3 or 4 minutes for a table, and especially if you're by yourself and only have a book or something, people are generally pretty nice about letting you share their table until one opens up.  \n\nSo, in summary, if you are a coffee snob, this probably isn't your place... if you're any other kind of snob, though, make sure you walk by the place a few times with your oversized sunglasses, gladiator sandals, & Sephora bag, carrying your Cavalier King Charles Spaniel puppy in your purse, so us scrubby kids taking up tables in the Coffee Tree have a chance to gawk at you for awhile.", "type": "review", "business_id": "1qUYk564SajvwTtkNM6KJA"}

Apparently right now they are the only nail salon in downtown Pittsburgh that has shellac. \n\nAt first, I passed it b/c I didn't see any bright flashing lights saying shellac, but then I did a double take b/c on the window there is a small poster advertising that they do shellac. So I went in to confirm that they do shellac and to get the costs - as some of you know it can be pricey. \n\nThey did confirm they did shellac and that without a full manicure that the cost would be $25 (slight grooming and painting only). I'm not sure how much the manicure and shellac would cost, but I thought $25 was a good deal for getting a 3-week polish job. And from what I heard it usually costs $35-40 bucks a pop. \n\nThey were very busy and asked if I could come later in the afternoon around 2:15 PM (I went there initially at 12:30 PM) and I said that was fine - luckily I have some flexibility with work.

It seemed even more crowded so I was worried that I'd be overlooked, but they asked what I was there for and I said shellac and they said, \"oh yes, 2:15 sit down\" and pointed towards a nail chair. \n\nSo I sat down and was greeted by Kammy - she was super nice and did an awesome job. I get a bit worried about some of these nail places cause they can do a pretty crappy job, but Kammy took her time (although it was clear she was very busy and people were waiting to see her). \n\nShe's the only one in the salon that does Shellac and she is there on Thurs., Fri, and Sat. So for my downtown working ladies (or men if you're in to that sort of thing) in the house - stop by and see Kammy to get a polish job that will be chip and smudge free for 3 weeks! \n\nMy nails look aaaaawesome! I got the bright pink color - I think it's called tutti fruity! \n\nOh and there was also a cute little girl that helped out after Kammy was essentially finished who put the oil on my cuticles and did the alcohol finishing step to make the nails all glossy. Be a star and make sure you tip her as well!", "type": "review", "business_id": "oH-N5ONrsWK8jWuq8p653w"}

We went there back in October.  We had just driven about 6 hours from Jersey to Pittsburgh, we got in kind of late and hungry, and decided to get something to eat here because it was so close to our hotel (and I did not want to get back in the car and drive somewhere.) \n\nThey had a good drink special (a couple of dollars for a margarita), and we got sandwiches and burgers.  Nothing amazing, but they hit the spot.  But, here's the part I'm still thinking about... they had a special that included the option of sweet potato tater tots.   Sweet Potato... Tater Tots.  Is that redundant?  Should it be Sweet Tater Tots?  I don't know, but I do know they were willing to substitute them with my sandwich even though I wasn't getting the special.  And I do know they were goood.  \n\nSo, now I'm a 6 hour drive away, it's two months later, and I'm still thinking about those Sweet Potato Tater Tots.  And, for that, I'm giving this place 4 stars.  \n\nSoHo is really close to PNC Park, and not too far from Heinz Field.  They also deliver (\"room service\") to the two hotels right there, Spring Hill Suites and Residence Inn.  Ask for the sweet potato tater tots.\n\nAs for me, I'm left wondering if sweet potato french fries (the more common menu cousin of the Sweet Potato Tater Tot) can ever truly be an adequate substitute, or if I need to go out and buy myself some sweet potatoes and try to tot them myself...", "type": "review", "business_id": "FtjvnLhh51ZBYEpKAARaFQ"}

The Asian fusion made for a delicious alternative to the typical calamari that was reminiscent of a General Tso's squid.

I also had a red-velved martini which I thought was probably the best part of the meal.\n\nOverall, I would definitely go back on a weeknight for happy hour or on a Tuesday to try the variety of mini martinis, but I think I'll leave paying $9 for an alcoholic beverage to \"special\" nights and not just a typical weekend dinner.\n\nThey do lose a star because even though we were one of three occupied tables and a few taken seats at the bar, the service was incredibly slow.

This definitely is not a place where you get a watered down drink. The place is dimly lit and the walls are dark, which makes for a comfortable setting, no matter how busy the bar is. There is live music, which is very good and isn't loud to the point that you can't hold a conversation with those around you.

My friend told me to pick wherever I wanted for a celebratory dinner, and Yelp brought me here.  The name was catchy, and the food looked cool.  And martinis are my drink of choice.  What's not to love?\n\nWe made reservations, but the bar upstairs was cooler so we went upstairs instead.  There are bar tables and couches and comfy chairs to hang out on.  The service was amazing, and we never wanted for anything.  Every need was met before we could even ask.\n\nI started out with the Orange Dreamsicle martini, and while it was on the sweet side, it was delicious!  If I return, I will definitely get another one of these.  Not strong alcohol wise but yummy.\n\nWe ordered the scallops and Asian fusion calamari for appetizers.  My friend was super upset with the scallops and thought they tasted bad.  I don't really know anything about scallops so I ate them.  He complained to the manager, and the manager was nice enough to take 1/2 off, which I thought was really nice considering it wasn't stopping me from eating them.  (#PoorKidProblems).  The calamari was really unique but delicious.  The actual calamari was good, but it was covered in some sauce similar to stir fry sauce.  It was good, and the portion was a really fair size for the price.\n\nI then moved onto the Key Lime Pie martini.  It was a let down after the Dreamsicle, but there was nothing wrong with it.  I personally preferred the first one.\n\nMy favorite food item was my entree.  I ordered the Penne ala Vodka, and when she put it on the table, I thought I had gone to garlic heaven.  Simple but wonderful.  There was also a very generous amount of asiago cheese on top of my pasta and a slice of prosciutto.  I took about half of the portion home, but I finished it off that night because it was so delicious.\n\nI really loved this place, and on a Friday night, it was EMPTY.  I don't know if this was because of Labor Day weekend or a Pirates game, but we were the only people in the bar area by 8:00.

It was totally worth it! \n\nWe arrived around midnight on a Friday (well, technically Saturday I guess) and there still was a decent crowd being the place is downtown. We ordered our drink upstairs and eventually made our way back downstairs and sat outside so my boyfriend and his friends could smoke. The upstairs is fairly big and definitely had enough room so you don't feel packed together. There is your basic bar seating, as well as couches and chairs that give it a lounge sort of feel. It didn't take anytime at all for a friendly bartender to notice us and take our drink order. \n\nThey had a lot of really interesting sounding drinks, but we decided to go with the Pumpkin Spice martini because it's October (like, duh!!). Wow! Now, I'm not one for martinis as I have mentioned in previous reviews for other places, but this was amazing! The best martini I've ever had. So delicious and super easy to take down, yet you could still taste the alcohol so you know they didn't short you. \n\nAfter spending some time upstairs, we traveled downstairs to check out the first floor. There was definitely a different vibe. It was slightly older and not as bumping. I also got to take a peak at their menu because I would love to come back and try their food. \n\nAs I mentioned above, we ended our night outside as they have a few tables and chairs. This is always the best because sometimes it's nice to escape the madness of a bar, especially if you're out with smokers.

You could tell it was a totally fun bar, and everyone seemed to be having a great time. We somehow managed to grab a seat up at the bar and ordered off their specialty martini list.\n\nIf you're feeling festive, definitely order the cake batter martini! It was AMAZING! The chocolate rim with sprinkles was a nice touch. I also ordered a regular vodka martini, which was excellent. \n\nThe only real drawback was that the service was really slow.

When Carrie suggested that we grab some drinks, I suggested that we go to Olive or Twist because I'd been wanting to check it out for awhile. I rarely receive the opportunity to go out for drinks after shows because some of my friends who I attend shows with tire out early (lame) or don't really go to bars ever (even lamer), so I was excited to finally have the opportunity to imbibe a few in a classy setting downtown.\n\nGiven that it was my birthday, I knew exactly what I wanted drink-wise, thanks to Rachel C.'s review: the cake batter martini!  Thanks to other reviews, I was aware that O or T's specialty martinis are dessert-y drinks rather than your typical martini.  This was absolutely fine by me, since I enjoy sweeter digestifs later at night.  As can be seen from my photo, this martini comes with a rim of chocolate syrup spangled with multicolored decorative sprinkles, which made for a very festive--and delicious--birthday drink.  Once I finished it, I went for a second round and chose the mint chocolate martini, which also came adorned with chocolate syrup.  It tasted exactly like melted mint ice cream--my favorite kind.  Yum!\n\nWe sat at the upstairs side bar, and service from the bartenders was generally good--one of them even wished me happy birthday when I mentioned why I was ordering the cake batter martini.  While it was busy, it wasn't so crowded as to feel claustrophobic.  The noise level was a bit on the loud side--but then again, what bar isn't?\n\nI really enjoyed my visit to O or T, and look forward to returning again, once I can convince my friends to stop by for a drink.  I'd love to check out the happy hour, in particular.  Because I haven't tried the regular (non-specialty) drinks or the food, I'm going with a 4, but I'll update my review once I return and do so.", "type": "review", "business_id": "OxIeMVcop5oxBUWANi-1Rw"}

The first time that we stopped was on a Sunday morning when the cart came into view with all of its nice looking breads.  I have walked by the cart and store many times before without really stopping to check it out.  That day we decided to though since I was hungry and did not want a full meal and boy am I glad that we did.  Originally I was just going to get one of the loaves of bread to have a bit then and save for later but then I noticed some true french bread pizza (aka pizza toppings on top of a slice of french bread) which I ended up getting.  While I was ordering that my fiance noticed some Sfogliatelle and she ended up ordering one of those as well.  I think the total cost was $3 and Jimmy told us the story of how the sfogliatelle was created while chomping on his cigar.  Both of our items were good and both my fiance and I were espcially impressed with the sfogliatelle.  It had a lot more filling than we are used to getting as well as a more orangy flavor which made it extra good.  Honeslty she was just happy to find a good Sfogliatelle in Pittsburgh.  She is Italian and is used to getting them with some family members at some Italian bakeries in NYC.  The second time that we came here was once again at the cart on a Sunday when Jimmy enticed us with sfogliatelle that was fresh out of the oven and still warm.  Finally the last time that we came was on a Saturday and so the whole store was open, not just the cart.  It was interesting to look around inside and see everything that I had been missing by walking past it all of these years. There were a number of display cases with a ton of baked goods in each of them and it also looked like they served a bunch of different lunch type items like sandwiches to go.  Jimmy once again waited on us and as always was super friendly and told us some stories that we enjoyed.  We ended up leaving this time with not only sfogliatelle for my fiance but also for her parents.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I will definitely be back here again in the future.

Instead of running school buses, the school district gave high schoolers bus passes to get to class, and I have used the bus since 1997.\n\nI've had a great experience using the bus in Pittsburgh. I didn't get a driver's license until I was almost 19--the bus (\"Miss Pat\"--another nickname) and my bike got me everywhere I needed to go. There will inevitably be delays and problems, but that is common to all modes of transportation. The price is right (especially with a \"free\" bus pass; students see below) and if you live and work in the city, you should consider making the bus your main means of commuting.\n\nThe system is largely built on the legacy of pre-World War II trolley lines, so the neighborhoods that were developed before 1950 are fairly well-served, while more recent developments can be harder to navigate by bus. The system just had a major overhaul (in spring 2010) but still travel many of the same routes.\n\nThe route numbering system is complicated, and there are many exceptions, but as a rule, the routes are numbered in a counter-clockwise fashion from downtown. The \"oughts\" and 10's go north, the 20's and 30's go west, the 40's and 50's go south, and the 60's, 70's, 80's an 90's go east. Routes that are just letters are express or flyer routes, which may go on one of three \"busways,\" transit-only highways that bypass traffic jams. The light rail (known as the \"T\" or the trolley) serves southern city and suburban neighborhoods above ground, and has three underground stations downtown, with a major construction project underway to extend trains to the North Side, projected for completion in 2011.\n\nThe University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University (among others) have agreements with the Port Authority to allow students, staff and faculty to use their university IDs as bus passes. Others can purchase passes at $75 per month or $20 per week, while a local one-way fare is $2.00. Port Authority is supposed to be rolling out a \"smart card\" digital payment system (\u00e0 la WMATA's SmarTrip or London's Oyster) soon, but that remains in development.\n\nOne especially great value is the 28X, a route serving the Pittsburgh International Airport from Downtown and Oakland (the university district) via the West Busway. Fare, as of mid-2010, is $2.75, compared with taxis and other shuttles costing $30 or more. The 28X runs every half hour and takes around 35 minutes to get to the airport from downtown, or 15 minutes longer from Oakland.\n\nThe Port Authority's fare revenues cover only a fraction of its expenses, and the state and county's perennial budget problems have caused several funding crises in recent years.", "type": "review", "business_id": "1n0n_-Iz0e3iVpH8sereiA"}

The food was large and in charge and sufficiently greasy to make sure you could function the next day.  I feel that grease and hooch battle it out in my tummy and grease always wins.

We went one morning after trying to get a seat at Coca Cafe.

I ended up ordering the famous Jojo's omelet and an endless cup of coffee.  It had peppers, onions, mushroom, spicy sausage, American and Provolone cheese as well as home fries.  The omelet itself was a giant monstrosity.  I have never seen an omelet so big before.  For a frame of reference, picture the largest calzone you've ever eaten.  It's probably bigger.  It's basically a heart attack on a palte.\n\nThe omelet itself was pretty much what you'd expect.  It's just all the typical ingredients in an omelet brought together.  If you're hungover over ravenous, it's definitely the place to be.  People who think Pamela's has large portions haven't seen anything yet.\n\nI hear they're open in the wee hours of the morning to cater to truckers driving through the area, so if you're out partying at one of the clubs in the strip and need food but don't want Primanti's, Jojo's is always available.", "type": "review", "business_id": "IEHaU93HpEbdUO4z4bKzDw"}

Annie and I are at Ross Park mall walking around trying to figure out our lunch destination when serendipitously her phone rings and it's her Dad, \"Brother Len\" calling to ask us to lunch at this hidden gem.  Nice!  I prefer not to make decisions on the weekend.  Next we are headed down to the strip on a relatively pleasant saturday afternoon.  The locals are out en masse and parking is at a premium.  In keeping with our serendipitous saturday theme we find prime parking right in front of Kaya (another one of our favs').  We walk towards \"Labad's grocery\".  Now, I've been to this grocery before and have certainly walked by it numerous times and had never known of the little cafe located in the back of the grocery.  Len's been a regular here for years and is friends with the lovely syrian family who own the joint.  We walk into the back room which is exactly what I was hoping for in that it was very small a few tables, middle eastern decorations on the wall and a cozy somewhat seperate room which had for some reason multiple stuffed animals next to the table.  There also was a sheet hanging blocking something from view and if I'm to believe Len it was a camel :-).  Annie and I have a seat with Len who is sitting with the patriarch of this family \"Fayed\" I believe his name is.  Fayed has to leave to tend to the store and multiple operations occurring.  One of the sons is selling \"shish kabob\" on the sidewalk.  This is also a grocery store with sidewalk sales and of course the small cafe in the back.  I love the entrepreneurial spirit of first generation immigrants.  Len orders me up some coffee.  It was a very strong version of coffee served in a tiny mug.  I'm guessing their version of espresso.  Len takes care of ordering, which is good because I can't claim to be a middle eastern food connoiessur and tend to be lost after I exhaust the hummus and gyro options.  He orders us some type of platter, not sure the name of the platter itself but can describe the offerings.  I liked the metal plate that all of this food was served.  It was a large round plate sectioned off for each dip/option.  It was served with warm pita bread.  I like family style dining and this platter certainly encouraged sharing.  Now, the only thing that I was familiar with was the hummus and the black olives.  The hummus was as good as any I've ever had.  It was very authentic mashed chickpeas blended with olive oil, lemon and garlic.  It was really good served with the pita chips.  The olives were really good briny small black olives served with the pit.  The other sides were Baba Ganoug, which is really good eggplant dip with oil, garlic and pepper.  I have tried this in the past and really didn't like it.  I really liked this, so I guess the stuff I had in the past wasn't authentic.  Now, one of the two new things I had and probably my favorite was the shanklish salad, which isn't the type of salad you may be thinking of.  There was no lettuce,  but instead homemade aged cheese that is very good and delicate.  The salad also consisted of onions, tomatoes and oil.  It was great.  The final side of this dish wsa the macdoose, which I had never tried before.  It is eggplant pieces stuffed with walnuts and drowned in olive oil.  This wasn't my favorite, but I found myself however I kept eating it, so I guess I must have thought it was okay.  This would have been a great vegetarian meal (first time I've ever said that sentence) if I stopped there.  But, Len also ordered me a skewer of lamb.  At first it was a bit undercooked, but one of the sons (Lawrence?) grabbed it and grilled it for a few more minutes and then it was more to my liking.  I really like lamb and grilled with middle eastern seasonings is a treat with a little pita and some onions and tomatoes.  Annie had a skewer of grilled chicken, which also was seasoned nicely and cooked well.  Throughout the lunch we were greeted like family from other members of the family including \"Mama\" who you just want to wrap up and take home with you.  The guy on the grill (another son can't recall name) also was very warm and friendly and had this killer \"handlebar\" mustache.  Fayed stopped back after we were done with lunch and spent some time chatting with us.  He is a really interesting guy and a true renaissance man with vocations that have included the military, principal in school, chef amongst other things.  One of the most interesting things I found about this guy is that in spite of being a syrian christian part of his history includes teaching the koran to the bedouin (nomadic desert dwelling arab group). A couple other notes Len who knows this type of food says it's the best authentic middle eastern food in Pittsburgh.  Next time I'm there I will definitely try the kibbee, which is spiced ground beef w/pine nuts and stuffing. It's a favorite and you can get it raw if you order in advance.  That would be adventorous.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9D4PMia-8WqCYXnr7TM0Pw"}

The sandwich bread is two thick slices of soft, white italian bread.  They put at least half a pound of meat on it, plenty of cheese, tomatoes, and a fresh coleslaw (not the mayonaissey type that I was expecting).  It's more like a marinated shredded cabbage, the marinade is tangy and vinegary.  The piece de resistance is that the sandwich also contains a huge mound of fries right in the middle.  The fries taste fresh, reminiscent of boardwalk fries back in the day, only better.  At the table they had ketchup, mustard and apple cider vinegar!  Any one from MD would appreciate that ;-)  All I needed was Old Bay seasoning and it woulda been heaven.  Maybe next time I'll take that in my purse...ssshh!

After I placed my order I waited by the bar and unfortunately it was when the death of Steve Mcnair started to air :-(. The bar quickly filled up after I placed my order. The sandwiches took a little while to prepare and not as quick as I've heard they are. I got my order and in my usual fashion I checked it. No chicken finger and fries....bummer.

I was planning to take it to go and eat at my hotel because there was no free parking out front. My hotel is by the airport so I wanted the sandwiches to be fresh as possible so that I can get the full experience. The chicken fingers took even longer to prepare so I am waiting and hoping my food doesn't get cold. Finally, after awhile watching the news my order is ready and I dash out and drive back to my hotel. First let me say the kids INHALED the chicken fingers like I never seen them do before and they have tried chicken fingers everywhere. The fries they didn't care for so much. I ate half my sandwich which was no longer hot and it wasn't bad, my wife didn't really care for hers since the amount of steak was skimpy. We would definitely try Primanti's again just not the ones we got this time and we will eat them at the location so that they are fresh as another complaint my wife had was the ingredients didn't seem fresh.

Now you can't swing a dead cat without hitting a restaurant that is piling anything on top of a sandwich to try to stand out.\n\nPrimanti's, however, isn't some new fad. They have been putting fries and cole slaw on their sandwiches for roughly 745 years (Note: that may be slightly innacurate, but the point is, they've been around a while). This started as a way for the blue collar workers of Pittsburgh to be able to carry their whole lunch in one hand, to eat on th go... and a great idea was born. Adding a fried egg to any sandwich is an option, and it is also almost always a good idea - and should be mandatory if you order the cappicola and cheese. \n\nPrimanti's has a lot of locations now, pretty much all around the Pittsburgh area, but unlike most chains, they seem to have suffered no growing pains from expansion, and every restaurant seems to be top notch and consistent in food quality. The regular sandwiches are big, but if you want to grow your waistline a couple inches in one sandwich, get the colossal fish. It is ridiculously large, and the fish is great. If you're feeling a little adventurous and have never had a real sardine before, try the sardine sandwich. These aren't those slimy little jarred bait fish you get in grocery stores. They are nice sized real sardines - a little oily, just enough briny sea flavor, and being Primanti's, you get plenty of them.\n\nIf you've never been to Primanti's before, its definitely worth a stop... and with locations all over the Pittsburgh area, they're easy to find.", "type": "review", "business_id": "NeUf9FyCCIN4MEseNyqkXQ"}

I've never heard of any place serving ginger ale in a cup, bottle or can in Texas, but here it seems to be everywhere!  Every place we stopped to eat and even a few bars recommended I try their ginger ale and it's really good!  So we all got that to drink.  \n\nTo start we tried the chili since it was posted on the wall as great chili.  A few friends told me \"don't get the chili, you're there for a sandwich.\"  They were right.  The chili wasn't good.  We don't put beans in chili here, and it should be thick, meaty, and able to eat through a spoon.  This stuff was weak, watery and full of beans and maybe some other vegetables.  Our chili would make people in Pittsburgh fall over dead.\n\nI got a double sweet and hot sausage sandwich, the wife had the Philly, and the kids had corned beef and a ham.  We had seen the hundreds of TV shows about this place and we were finally here to see if the mix of coleslaw, fries and meat was really as awesome as they say it is.   They were right.   The sandwiches didn't seem as big as they were on TV but they were freakin' awesome.  We all enjoyed these sandwiches more than any sandwich we had ever had before.   We had just had a long day of eating tons of bacon and bacon booze, so I didn't think any of us would be able to finish a big sandwich.  WE DID.  It was soooo good.  \n\nThe only bad part about coming to Pittsburgh and visiting Primanti Bros is that we had to go back home the next day!", "type": "review", "business_id": "NeUf9FyCCIN4MEseNyqkXQ"}

It was just easier throw everything in the sandwich, wrap it up and give it to you.... and it caught on.  Now it's a big deal, I guess. \n\nBut, I'm not trying to be negative here.  Bottom line is that I enjoyed my pastrami sandwich.  If I ever go again, I think I'd throw a fried egg on there too.

Getting its name from the bedroom community it's located in, Dormont, it benefits from a charming mini-downtown area immediately around it, as well as lots of brick houses, although some have seenbetter days. \n\nDor-Stop is diner chic through and through, serving the breakfast and lunch crowds only. Nic nacs and local sports teams' placards adorn the walls, as well as a proudly displayed signed poster from Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives after that show's stop here. A mix of booths, tables and a few counter seats could cram several dozen people in.\n\nYou don't have to do any research about what's popular here, just take a look at a good chunk of the menu or what the person next to you is eating: the hotcakes. With a dozen options, there's a lot of choice and they're all tempting. I settled on the apple walnut hot cakes with sausage on the side. We didn't have to wait long but it felt like a while hungrily watching all the delicious looking food come out of the open kitchen or sitting in the window.\n\nOnce in front of me, I was staring at three thick hot cakes with apples chunks and walnuts cooked into them and topped with icing sugar, along with two sausage rounds. The hot cakes were utterly fantastic, with a pleasing denseness but with just enough air in them to keep them from being chewy, The apples were cooked perfectly, soft but not mushy, and along with the walnuts added some texture. I was initially disappointed that the sausage came in round form instead of links as they tend to be drier, but these were nicely browned and still juicy, albeit a bit too greasy. \n\nMy girlfriend went for the lunch time food, getting the Chick 'O' Philly hoagie  which came with sliced chicken breast, sauteed mushrooms, onions and green peppers, tomato lettuce and Swiss cheese. It was a winning combination of ingredients and the thick bun made for a even heftier sandwich, and as a good sandwich should be it was greater than the sum of its parts. The fries it came with were a solid entry - lightly browned, thick cut but still nice and crispy. \n\nOn a return trip, I went with the plain hot cakes and they were just as good as the apple walnut ones, a sign of great fundamentals when you're doing something as seemingly basic as a hot cake. Kudos. \n\nService was friendly and attentive, with a ton of coffee top ups. You'll be challenged to get past half empty in your cup at any point in the meal.\n\nDor-Stop seemed like just a convenient spot to fuel up for a day of tourism but turned out to be a damned good spot with memories of its own: the best pancakes I've ever had.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw"}

Prices are very reasonable in my opinion as my husband and I both eat for under $20. \n\nI love the Dor-stop and highly recommend it to others!", "type": "review", "business_id": "2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw"}

It was several years ago that I first came upon The Dor-Stop, and since then my breakfast lifestyle has been forever changed.\n\nI know this will sound like blasphemy coming from a Dor-Stop convert, but I hate pancakes. I just don't understand them, they are odd and moist, and nowhere near as delicious as waffles. I came into The Dor-Stop the first time with this mindset, and am now forever changed. \n\nThe Dor-Stop's hotcakes are delicious and almost cake-like. They aren't thin crepes, or undercooked globs of batter, but instead sweet, fluffy treats that come in a plethora of flavors. I personally endorse oatmeal walnut, but others love the banana or pumpkin (when in season). I recommend ordering the \"Egg Combo\": 2 hot cakes, eggs, and bacon/sausage. Go all out, you deserve it. \n\nOn a recent visit, I also discovered the french toast menu, which has caused me to forsake my hot cake habit. The french toast is almost deep fried and covered in this raspberry yogurt. It is a can't miss item on the menu, rivaling that of the hot cake. When pumpkin french toast is a special on the menu, I suggest you run to The Dor-Stop and taste a little of heaven. \n\nI've also sampled various items from the lunch menu with no complaints. The Rachel and Ruben are especially tasty if you feel like bypassing the breakfast menu. \n\nThis place is truly heaven in Dor-Stop. Make sure you arrive early on a weekend morning to avoid the crowd! Or wake up at dawn on a weekday and partake (as I have been known to do from time to time!)", "type": "review", "business_id": "2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw"}

But hey, they definitely deserve it! In fact Dor-Stop is so good that I came here two days in a row a couple weekends ago - once for a sit-down meal, and once to get a meal to-go just so I could try a second item on the menu.\n\nI actually hadn't eaten at Dor-Stop in years until earlier this month - their hours and my schedule don't tend to mesh. But one afternoon I just happened to be using 1/2 a vacation day, so I came with a family member. Since it was the middle of the day on a Friday, the place was fairly empty, which I definitely didn't mind - this place is pretty cozy and so it gets cramped quickly during weekend dining rushes.\n\nBut on to the food, the important part of this review! My dining companion ordered a salad - complete with French fries, 'cause that's how we do salads in Pittsburgh - and I ordered their Feta Burger. Sure, their Raspberry stuffed french toast caught my eye...but Feta burger! How often do you see that on the menu? And I loved that burger, by the way - it was well cooked and the toppings blended perfectly (I snagged a few mushrooms from my companion's salad which made it even better), and definitely felt like good diner food. I left feeling super happy with my meal.\n\nBuuuuut...the next day I still couldn't get that french toast of my mind. I just couldn't. So I called in an order for pick-up - good thing I did, too, because there was nowhere to sit when I came in! Saturdays are definitely jam-packed here, understandably so. Well, I got my food, brought it home, and proceeded to devour it. Just, YUM! Seriously - that french toast is a MUST!\n\nIf I was going to complain about anything it would be that the seating really isn't the most comfortable on the planet, buuuuut...I can't hold it against them. I just can't. Not after that french toast. See you next time, Dor-Stop!", "type": "review", "business_id": "2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw"}

There's not much seating, the t.v. is a tiny tube job from the 80's, and your pie comes on a piece of cardboard wrapped in a paper bag. \n\nAnd the service? Well, they're efficient. They don't care if you like them, they just want to get you your food, and fast. \n\nBut who cares? The reason I make it a personal mission to go to Camps every time I return to Pittsburgh is the pie. It's thin and crisp, yet solid. Nice browning all over. The sauce is a well-seasoned red gravy that provides a tasty base for the copious amounts of mozzarella and whatever other toppings you want. Me, I go for the pepperoni - which is the type that cups up in the oven, forming little pools of fat - and anchovies. \n\nIt's spectacular, and reasonably priced.

D's has a great system, if you buy a bottle of beer to take out of the restaurant they take 1 dollar off the bottle.  This dollar off doesn't matter when you consider how small a normal bottle is, but when you look at the larger bottles it does.  The prices for their larger bottles with the dollar off are not much higher than you would pay in a specialty beer shop in a less regulated state.  The only problem is that you have to commit to drinking three or four beers instead of one - I'm not really seeing the issue with that, but I'm sure someone will.  \n\nAlso, I've never eaten here, because hot dogs are generally not good.  Furthermore, I'm not sure why anyone would go to a hot-dog joint and expect good service.  So ignore anyone talking about hot-dogs and come here for the beer.

The bartenders are all amazing people and really make you feel comfortable. The service is great and they are always ready with a recommendation for any newbies.

I love their wings and their hot dogs. \nEverytime I go there i am greeted with fun young employees ready to serve or offer suggestions about their latest brews. Their draft list changes constantly so there's no sense in trying to remember which beer you had there the week before. Plus their beer cave is great with hundreds of different bottles to choose from all listed by the region from which they came. They also have a small cooler with about 150 different varieties of beer that are already chilled for your liking. Even if you get a warm beer, they have this ice cold dunk tank to put your bottle in that gets it nice and chilly for you in just a few minutes. That by far is my favorite aspect of D'z. If you choose to take beer home with you they also have a discount of $1.00 per bottle of every beer you take with you(excluding the pre-made six packs). So sometimes we get a six pack of variety beers at a lower cost than paying for them individually. On to the food:\n\nI love their wings and hot dogs and my masterful veggie burger creation. We always order the BBQ sauce because it taste so gooooood and their wings are nice and crispy and hot and smothered in plenty of sauce that you will be licking your fingers. We've tried almost all their dogs expect 2 and my favorite is the mac and cheese dog(w/ ketchup) and the chihuahua dog which is avocado, shredded cheddar cheese and jalapenos, my fiance enjoys a classic Chicago dog. The have delicious sauerkraut that i enjoy as well so i usually get a side for only 99 cents. Can't beat that price. Now when it comes to the veggie burger i love the way it taste. I do it up real nice by getting that black n blue topping which is blue cheese and cajun seasoning. I add bacon, onion, mushrooms, avocado, tomato, lettuce and their spicy mayo/double dip sauce. It is hands down the best burger i've ordered in a loooong time. \n\nIf your looking for a fun hangout spot for you and your buddies or even a tasty treat for the kids then D'z is where it's at!!! It gives you the feeling of just a fun place to be on the weekend or even the weekdays. \n\nDue to an unfortunate circumstance of eating at a different hotdog shop during restaurant week, my fiance would have proposed to me at D'z.

I had the Chihuahua hot dog with a veggie hot dog and added grilled onions and my partner had a specialty Octoberfest hot dog. Both were large and delicious. We did not have to wait long for a Friday night and the service was excellent. The space tends to be crowded so this is not the place to go for a quiet fancy dinner, but the food and drinks were excellent and we will definitely be back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2X5G4Ujq0s4Wfn4TC7gX0g"}

Their main specialty is beer and that is what I always have so I can not speak to any liquor or wine options.  The beer selection is awesome.  They have over 1000 different kinds of beer.  You just have to make your selection and they will open it for you at your table.  You can also create your own mix and match 6 pack to carry out.  \nNow on to the food.  If you get french fries - I am warning you, the portion is very large.  The ones with bacon and cheese are a great.  We tried both the wet and dry wings and were happy with both.  Now the reason we came here; the hot dogs.  And oh are they amazing.   They have hot dogs combinations on the menu, but you can also create any combination that you want.  I am a HUGE fan of the Chicago Dog - they do it right!!!  \nOn a side note - if you like Root Beer, they have a great root beer on draft.  They do offer a children's menu as well and it is completely fine for children in the middle of the day.  You see tons of families.  \nThe staff has always been very friendly and helpful.  They know their beer and food very well!\nIf you have never been here; I recommend it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2X5G4Ujq0s4Wfn4TC7gX0g"}

It's nice to have an easy, fun, casual place to get some good eats and a nice beer. As a vegetarian who still likes to pretend to eat meat, I so appreciate their multiple veggie options. Nearly any item on the menu can be made in a vegetarian version. Their special dogs (dog of the month) are usually a lot of fun. My favorite was the Thanksgiving dog back in November, with corn, mashed potatoes, cranberry, and stuffing. It was amazing! I came twice to have one in November. \n\nTheir beer list has to be the best I've seen in the city. Lots of great stuff on tap and a huge bottle room. \n\nSince we like to bring our toddler to dine with us, I'm always so happy that they are so friendly and accommodating with kids. He loves their mac and cheese and grilled cheese sandwiches, though I think he likes their crayons more.\n\nFor a fun family dinner, a good beer, watching a game, getting together with friends, or just experimenting with a new Belgian brew, I strongly recommend D's.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2X5G4Ujq0s4Wfn4TC7gX0g"}

Even so, the two different orders my friends and I shared were both very tasty, although very fried and crunchy, compared to the meatier seitan wings served up elsewhere in Pittsburgh.\n\nTheir vegan dog on a poppy seed bun comes with unlimited toppings, for just 4.99! They somehow managed to get avocado, grilled onions, tomato, pickle spears, brown mustard, and banana peppers stacked into mine, and it was delicious and filling.

The hot dogs looked delicious, and my friends are real beer fans, so we thought it'd be perfect.  It was better than expected.  \n\nFirst, obviously, the beer selection is amazing. You can either order off their menu, choose a beer from their walk-in fridge, or venture back into the Beer Cave (where they've got every beer ever) and throw a bottle or too in the chiller.  Five minutes later, the beer's cold and delicious. We all took advantage of this, and picked up six packs on the way out.  \n\nSecond, the hot dogs were really good. I definitely recommend the Angry Tiki dog.  Sweet, spicy and really delicious. \n\nThe only thing is they don't handle groups well. There's plenty of room, but once we'd already split up our check amongst everyone's credit card, we were told they don't usually do that for more than 6 people.  The guy did it for us anyway, but it took awhile, and I'm still not really sure who got charged for what.\n\nIf you're in the area, or even almost in the area, make a trip to D's.

The first time I came here our server was super chill and chatty with us as well as patient while we took our time figuring out how many add-ons to pile on top of our food despite the busy atmosphere of the place.\n\nThe food is cheap and hits the spot, for meat eaters and vegetarians alike. I will say their seitan wings were particularly crunchy/dry and not altogether satisfying shared between people, but the flavors were great.\n\nBut let's be real, you're probably coming here for the dogs. It's cool, I do too. And you will probably want to add avocado to whatever it is you're getting, because avocado is for winners, just like the ocean.\n\nOne night, during some seriously biblical amounts of rain and lightning, the power went out temporarily and workers and patrons alike kept on going like it was -no big deal-, demonstrating that the strength of D's can weather any storm.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2X5G4Ujq0s4Wfn4TC7gX0g"}

He had an IPA by Sierra Nevada and I had the Boulder Shake Chocolate Porter. Both were awesome and their draft list is decent. About 15-20 craft beers on tap. \n\nWe each ordered a sandwich. Their menu wasn't large but they had more than just your typical bar food, definitely more interesting items. I got a chicken sandwich named the chihuahua--chicken, avocado, cheddar cheese, salsa and jalape\u00f1os. It was amazing! Their sandwiches automatically come with chips (which I'm never a fan of) but I was able to substitute them for French fries. Their fries were amazing, they were the kind that are battered and those are my favorite (very few places around the burgh sell them like that) so this was very exciting to me. Overall the price isn't bad either which was awesome. After dinner my boyfriend and I both go my 6 packs to go.. They have an awesome selection..

Mind you, this was a total stranger. But I liked the mystique so obviously I jumped in my car and found D's (her directions were perfect.) \n\nWalking into the beer cave is an almost religious experience. What's this to my immediate left? Seasonal brews? Yes, I'll definitely have some of those. Trippel Belgians? Count me in. Beers brewed by monks? Of course. All the Dogfish Head and Rogue a girl could ever want? Double check. Giant bottles of Chimay? I must be dreaming. And if you thought things couldn't get any better, you're clearly not following along close enough-you get $1.00 off every bottle you take to go. \n\nBobby and I brought a friend here last night because he said he had never been. We stocked up on pumpkin beers and they even had Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin Ale which I can never seem to find anywhere. Our friend was in awe. The only downside I can possibly think of when it comes to D's is the magical time powers that seem to exist in the beer cave. I kid you not, I've sometimes found myself in the beer cave for over 45 minutes agonizing over crafting the perfect six pack. Of course, this isn't D's fault.

Although they are a chain, the food is always A+ and the atmosphere is fun!\n\nI was first introduced to Mad Mex about three years ago. Not knowing what to expect I thought that it was just another Mexican restaurant.  Mad Mex is awesome from their chips and salsa, to their burritos to their margaritas, never a bad meal, drink, or service! I have been here for both lunch and dinner. \n\nThe atmosphere is very fun too, the art is pretty cool  and resembles the Mexican Day of the Dead, and it just has a relaxed vibe to it. It is a casual place so you are perfect in jeans!\n\nTheir margaritas are really good and reasonably priced. Are you a beer drinker? They have a ton of beers that they serve and a decent amount on tap. Around fall they have an awesome selection of fall beers and they have pumpkin beer.\n\nAlso in fall they have this wonderful little thing called a gobblerito.  You must try it,  it is the most amazing thing I have ever tried.  Although to some the idea may sound gross, you MUST give it a try!!! A gobblerito is: turkey, stuffing,  corn, some black beans, and mashed potatoes all wrapped up neatly in a burrito shell. You get gravy and cranberry sauce as a side! A must try for fall!!!!\n\nWhile I have been to other locations, Greentree is my favorite! !!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "hhNlQWaKqGbMPoeZHoL-IQ"}

A friend of mine had taken a sushi class there and LOVED it, so I had total confidence in buying the class for my sister and I to do together. When I first searched, they didn't have a sushi class on the schedule. I emailed them to find out and they said to check back in the spring. As I was scrambling two weeks before Christmas to figure something else out to get my sister, they emailed ME and said that they added a sushi class for February and for me to go register so I'd have it in time for my sister for Christmas. It was really nice because I had already started looking for something else, so great on the sales end on their part.\n\nThere were 18 people in our class and we were in the demonstration kitchen. We learned how to roll three different types of sushi, and all of the steps that go along with it. Everyone had such a great time making their own sushi, and eating it too! I signed up for the email newsletter, and I'm already thinking of occasions to rent it out for private parties!
